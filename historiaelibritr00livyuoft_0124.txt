murders may not be unrewarded.''

⁴⁶ Nupta diceretur] i. e. Married nominally, not in reality.

nimity of her husband. Tacita, “in silence,’' without mur-

accompam'ed by inactivity.

⁴⁸ Quin accinyeris] Literally “ why are you not girded up ?’'
why not prepare yourself for this enterprise ’ἓ The expression is
borrowed from the practice among the ancientS, when about to
enter on a journey or other active business, of tying up with a
girdle the outside robe, which was usually loose and flowing.

⁴⁹ Pereqrina reqna moliri] You are not obliged like your
father to set out from Corinth or Tarquinii “to struggle for’'
(moliri) foreign kingdoms: i. e. to which as a foreigner you can
have no claim.

⁵⁰ Dii te penates ...... et nomen Tarquinium creat] Here the
number of the last of several subjects determines the number
of the verb. This is a remarkable instance of deviation from
one of the first principles of grammar, where it is laid down,
that, if a verb have several nominative cases, it must be plural.
