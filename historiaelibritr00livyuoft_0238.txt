220 NOTES To BOOK 11. c. 49, 50.

⁹¹ Populatiom‘bus] “ The depredations were not long discon-
tinued

⁹² Ordines introeunt] “ While the lines following their colom-s
are advancing to the ground.” See B. 3. c. 38. n. Walker
thinks ordines is the acc. case, and explains it thus : dum Veientes
introeunt ordines post siqua, i. e. dum aciem diriqunt. But he has
given no instance of this most strange and unnatural use of the
word introeunt, nor have I met with this use of it.

em. L.-⁹³ Majoris belli apparatu] For majore belli appa-
ratu. So B. 1. c. 1, majora initia rerum, for majorum initia
rerum—B. 2. c. 51, proximam puqnoe εἷαᾱεπι, forprooeimae puqnoe
cladem ,- hesterna felicitate puqnoe, for hesternae felicitate pugnet.—
B. 28. c. 17, consummata belli qloria, for consummati belli qloria.

1. c. 3, florentem, ut tum res erant, atque opulentam civitatem.

⁹⁵ Ex re natum] “ Suggested by present circumstances.”

⁹⁸ Quanquam rara hostium apparebant arma.] i. e. The appear-
ance of some scattered bodies of the enemy did not teach them
cantion.

sense

⁹⁸ Et adversi et undique] “ Both in from: and on every side of
them.”

⁹⁹ Tela accidebant] “Weapons were falling? So, Caes. Bell.
Gall. B. 3. c. 14, and 25, tela acciderent .· accedebant was the
reading of the MSS. and old copieS.

¹ Multitudiroem] Scil. insiqnemfaciebai.

² Multiplicatis in arcto ordinibus] Because the lines of the
Tuscans grew more numerous, as the space grew narrower.
Robortellus, on the other hand, B. 2. annot. c. 30, says multipli-
catis here means, not “ more numerous,” but “ condensed,” den-
satis ,· to signify that the Tuscans, who before, when scattered,
appeared few, now appeared numerous when wedged closely to-
gether, He says, quo enim breviore in spatio coqitur acies, eo
pauciores ordines esse, necesse est

⁸ Inclinat] ‘⁵ Tbey bend their force.'’

⁴ Εὸ, nisi corporibus armisque] “Towards that place they,
exerting the force of their bodies and arms, and forming them-
selves into the shape of a wedge, burst a passage.''

in verticem collis euasisset] This passage exemplifies what I have

formed thus, Q ΑΩ , where the middle part, between eir nechs,
