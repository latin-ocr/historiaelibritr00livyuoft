by distrusting him, pronounce unworthy of confidence, lest he
should prove a more deadly enemy.'' Crevier says that fidem
abroqare means “ to give up all confidence i'n one, to distrust him,”
and therefore thinks non credendo an unnecessary tautology.
But Walker understands, more correctly, the phrase to mean
“to pronounce unworthy of confidence‚ to destroy one’s eredit;”
(see Cic. pro. Q. Rosc. n. 44, and 1. 4.—Acad. Quaes. n. 36,) and
does not consider non credendo useless—See also B. 1. c. 59. n. 82.

Ἡ sisti] See B. 2. c. 29. n. 52.

³⁵ Emerqentibus] This word is considered faulty. All the
best writers of the Augustan age have avoided the use of ac
before words beginning with a vowel. Blerqentibus is the word
proposed as its substitute. Drakenborch and Crevier imagine
that rempublicam is the object of it; but Walker thinks this too
far-fetched, as this, or a similar word, does not occur before or
after3 he considers malum illud tribunicium to be the object3 thus
“no one feared the tribunes or plebeians, so much did other evils rise
above, and sink the consideration of these.''--So B. 6. c· 14, mer-
qentibus sortem usuris. I conceive Walker’s explanation the more
natural one, if emerqentibus be certainly incorrect3 if not, as Ι
(10 not think it is, the passage may, in my opinion, be thus very
simply explained: “ so much did other evils abound and appear
prominent.’'—See next ch. n. 41, for this use of nepem, and
emer-90 is often used in the same sense.

³⁵ Ad id propa] “ But that alone almost proved the greatest
aggravation to their distress;’' literally, “ leaned with heavy
weight on their sinking fortunes.'' “

3’ Patriciorum] “ That the guests and dependants of the
patricians, (whom the tribunes pretended to be the persons that
seized on the citadel) if they find, after the law is carried, that
they have raised a useless tumult, will go off, &ef They want
the people to pass the law quickly, in order to put an end to the
general tumult. ,

CHAP. ΧῩΙΙ.-38 Templum] i. e. The comitium—See Β.
2. c. 56. n. ἰ’-1.

³⁹ Jupiter optimus] See B. 1. c. 55. n. 23.

⁴⁰ Tantum hostium] “ An immense force of the enemy.”
Tantum may be sometimes considered, as here, not in a relative
sense, but merely in the signification of multum or maqna vis.

⁴¹ Superat] “Abounds;” it is the same as superest. Livy
often uses it in this sense.--See B. 5. c. 21.

*Β Non quiequid patrum] ‘⁵ Ought not all the patricians and
plebeians, the consuls, tribunes, &c.'‘ Gronovius thinks that,
in place of deos, we- should read cives, which would render the
passage an elegant climax3 for there was a. great number of
citizens who did not reside in the city.

‘³ Consularis imperii] “ Regardless of the limits within
which the consular power should be confined.”
