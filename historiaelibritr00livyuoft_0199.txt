Nora-s 'ro’ Boon 11. c. 1, 2. 181

this occasion, dismounting, led along (traducebant) their horsea
before the Censor, who was seated in his curule-chair; and thus
they were reviewed (recoqnoscebantnr) by him. If a knight
was corrupt in morals, or diminished his fortune, or even ne-
glected his horse, the Censor ordered him to sell his horse, and
he was thus removed from the order 3 hence adimere equum.
The first knight in the Censor’s list was called princeps juven-
tutis.

¹¹ Traditum] “ From this is said to have been handed down
the practice of summoning (by the public crier, see B. 3, c. 38,
“ or by proclamation, edictum) into the senate those who were
fathers, and those who were conscript.’' This word conscripti was
asterwards applied to all the senators. conscripti properly meant
those who were enrolled with the old senators, from conscribere,
“ to enrol.'' Patres conscripti properly meant patres et conscripti.

¹² Mirum quantam] See Β. l. c. 16. n. 2.

¹⁸ Patribus] Livy had just mentioned that the chiefs of the
equestrian order were chosen into the senate3 Dionysius says
they were plebeians3 hence we may suppose that they were
mostly, if not all, plebeians, but possessing the fortune of
knights. Festus, Β. 15, says, that one hundred and sixty-four
plebeians were at this time admitted into the senate. This
seems to agree with Dionysius.

Cau» 11.-¹⁴ Ne ubiubi.] “ Lest there should be felt a want
of kings in any matter whatever, they appoint a king of the
sacrifices.” Ubiubi, like qualisqualis, quantusquantus, undeunde,
for qualiscunque, ᾇτ’. This king of the sacrifices, whom they
made subject to the jurisdiction of the pontiff, was not allowed
to hold any civil office, or harangue the people. The readings
are various, such as necubi, necubi ibi, necubi ubi ; ne ubiubi
seems to be most approved of ; but I confess, though Ι
have given ubiubi in the text, and also the explanation of it which
1 have found in the commentators, I think the word at best
an awkward one. Ne ullam ibi, or ne ibi simply, which some
MSS. warrant would in my judgment be a better reading.—
Reqem sacrificulum; he is elsewhere called reqem sacrificum,
reqem sacrificiomtm, and reqem sacrorum.

¹⁵ Nescio an modum excesserint] ‘⁶ Ι (10 not know but that
they exceeded the proper bounds.''

¹⁶ Ne intervallo quidem fact0, oblitu-m, tanquam alieni, requi]
“ T hat Tarquin the Proud did not even, in consequence of the
interval that elapsed, (i. e. the reign of Serv. Tullius) give up
all thoughts of the kingdom, as ot· a thing which really belonged
to another, (as he ought,) but. that he thought to regain it by
guilt and violence, as if it were the inheritance of his family.”

¹⁷ Tentantium animos sermo] “ This lang-uage, used by per-
sons at first gradually sounding the dispositious of the people,
was circulated.”
