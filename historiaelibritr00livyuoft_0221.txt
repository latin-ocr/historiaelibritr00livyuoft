⁸¹ Tante‘t quum ςνατίἂ, tum arte praeparaverant faeneratores, quoe
...... frustrarentur] “ With so much influence and art had the
usurers concerted measures, that defeated .'’ The usurers
were chiefly patricians, and that is the reason why he says
plebeians and patricians were sti-ll anxious about the result of
their private concerns, i. e. the subject of debts.

⁸² Actionzcm in senatu primam habuit. ] “ Of all his public acts
in the senate, he made that, in favour of the victorious people,
” the first3 and proposed the question, what would they wish
should be done to the condemned debtors. 9” Any. act or
. measure of a magistiate,bef01e the senate or people, is called
actio. De nexis would be a better reading. However the
preposition is elsewhere omitted in such a case. So Β. 27. e.
16, interroqczutz' scribae quodfieri siquis vellet.

⁸⁸ Me diusfidius] There are various explanations for these
words. Some say dius is deo (i. e. Jove) ortus scil. Hereules3
andfidz'us is fidei praeses, and that the phrase is elliptical; thus
ita me dius fidius (scil. deo ortus Hercules fidei praeses) juvet,
Others say me is the same as μοὶ, per, and dius-fidius is dei filius,
scil. Hercules, as the ancients often used d for l—Thus the
phrase would mean per dei (Jovis) filium, scil. Herculem. So we
find me Hercule, me Cast or.

 

⁸⁴ Mei similes] See B. 3. c. 41. n.

⁸⁵ Seditiom· interero] “ I shall witness sedition rather as a
priv ate individual. ’³

*ὅ Apparuit causa plebi] ‘The cause was evident to the

⁸⁸ Per causam] “Under the p1·etext.’Causari means “to
allege as an excuse, or pretext. ’'—See B. 3. c. 64.

³⁹ Nullam. .reli9,ionem eoesolvi] “That no religious obli-
gation is dissolved.'’ Nulla reliqione exsolvi, “ ‘to be releascd
from no religious obligati0n‚’' is another way of expressing this
sentiment. So solvere obsidionem and obsidione are the same.—
See B. 44. c. 30.

⁹⁰ Sacrum montem] So called because the people, on thei r
return to the city, dedicated it to Jupiter. See a full account of
this event in Dionysius, B. 6. p. 375, who coincides with Livy,
as also Plut. in Vit. Coriol„ and Appian Alex. in Hannib.

⁹¹ Piso auctor est, in Aventinum] Sallust adopts this opinion,
Bell. Jug. c. 31, and says, that the people retired to it twice,
i. e. at this time, and after the death of Virginia-See B. 3.
