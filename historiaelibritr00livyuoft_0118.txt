of the passage, whatever be the reading.

¹ Arma mutata, nihil praeter hastam et verutum datum] Veru-
tum was a short dart, headed with a piece of iron resembling a
spit (veru) ,· it is supposed to be a casting dart, hurled by means
of a string. The spear (hasta) was given for close fight. See
B. 8. c. 24. Though the arms of this class were lighter than
those of the former, yet they were not properly velites, or
light-armed troops. The hasta was not always used in close fight,
as Cic. (de Senectute, e. 6,) shows: nec eminus hastis, nec eominus
qladiis meretum-As he here mentions hasta and verutum for
different purposes, so he mentions hasta and qaesa, B. 8. c. 8.
Dionysius says, this class had ἐυξέους τὲ, καὶ ξιφῆ, καὶ δῆςαται, scu-
taque, qladiosque, pilaque. So after he attaches the musicians
not to the fifth class, like Livy, but to the fourth.

³ Aucta] Increased in the number of centuries

³ In his accensi cornicines tubicinesque in tres centurias distri-
buti] This passage has opened to the commentators a wide
field for criticism. Most of them, as the words thus stand,
think that these three centuries consisted of three kinds of per-
sons, horn-blowers, trumpeters, and extraordinaries, or super-
numeraries, accensi. These accensi, of whom Livy speaks, B.
8. c. 8, were kept ,for the purpose of filling any vacancies caused
by death, διο. ; they were also the coadjutors or servants of the
centuriens and other Officers ; they were sometimes posted among
the light-armed troops. Some think that in his means, “ included
among the centuries of the fifth class ;’' and, according to these,
the entire number of centuries must be one hundred and ninety-
one. Others again think that these three centuries were addi-
tional; and that in before his should be expunged. And
some go so far as to imagine that in duas should be substi-
tuted for in trec, because Dionysius says, there were only two
centuries consisting of horn-blowers, trumpeters, and other
musicians, which were added to the fourth class. I think this
would better correspond with the distribution of the centuries
into senior and junior, and with the two centuries of mechanioe.
But if, says Walker, we make accensi, according to Perizonius,
a verb, and read (according to a MSS. of Vossius, which, 1
think, he means by unus codex manuscriptus,) the whole passage
thus, in his accensi cornicines tubicinesque inter centurias distri-
buti, it will be very plain—“ among these, (i. e. the centuries
of the fifth class) were reckoned the horn-blowers and trumpeters,
who were distributed through all the centuries.” They were
obliged to have the same property as the centuries of the fifth
class, and paid the same tax, yet they formed no distinct body
by themselves, but were distributed through the centuries of the
several classes, as there was occasion for them. Even by re-
taining tres, if we make accensi a verb, we can suppose that
