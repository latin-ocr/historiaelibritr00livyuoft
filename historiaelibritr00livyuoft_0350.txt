⁸⁷ AE'quo omnium decoravi-rorum imperia] The comment-ators say
that these words mean, “ that Oppius and Claudius were to have
the same authority as if all the decemvirs were present.'' Then
there must be an unclassical ellipsis, and the passage be com-
pleted thus ε AEquo omnium decemvirorum imperio eorum imperio
existente, “their power being equal to the power of all the
decemvirs.” It appears much more simple and natural to explain
the passage thus: “The power of all the decemvirs being the
same ;'’ i. e. that the decemvirs, both those who went to the army,
and those who remained in Rome, should every one of them
alike possess absolute authority-3 and in this case Oppius and
Claudius would have as much power as if all the decemvirs were
in the citv.

CHAP. XL11.—⁸⁸ Auspicia] When the Roman general was
about to engage in any important undertaking, he ascertained
the will of heaven by making observations on certain birds, which
was peculiarly termed auspicium, (qu. avis et aspicio ,·) hence,
such an undertaking was said to be carried on under his “ aus-
pices,'' whether he was present or n0t; sometimes the omens
were taken in his name by his deputy, and the affair was still
said to be conducted under his auspices, as was the case in the
time of the Roman emperors, under whose auspices the generals
were said to carry on war in the distant provinces.

ἢ Pet-secutis hos-tibus] “ Engaging no where in even combat
with the enemy who pursued them.'' Per-secutis hostibus is the
dative casa—See B. 5. c. 18, nec se tamen aequo loco horti
commisit.

⁹⁰ Utensilihus] This word signifies ‘⁶ any implement or
vessel for use;’' it also sometimes means “ provisions and
money.'’——See Tacit. B. l. 70, note, (Oberlin's ed.)—2. 60„-

⁹¹ Ad supplementum] Gronovius thinks the reading should
be ac supplementum. Drakenborch explains the present reading
thus: “ In addition to a reinforcement of troops to supply the
places of the slain ;'' ad certainly sometimes means “ in addition
to, besides.'’—See e. 29. n. 67. and next ch. beginning. It may
however be simply explained thus: “they decreed to send to
Tusculum arms for the purpose of a suppl-y3 i. e. to supply those
that ware lost at Alqidus ; for in the words utensiltbus emam, a
little before, may be included the loss of their arms3 supplemen-
tum means a supply of any thing, though the usual signification
of it is a “supply of men,” and ad often means “ for, for the
sake of.’' Tusculum a-rma-decernerent, soil. mittere. So Cic.
decerne leqiones in Syriam; or, as arma is often taken in a
general sense to signify *‘ all kinds of tools for all arts and occu-
pationS‚” it may here include not only arms offensive and defen-
