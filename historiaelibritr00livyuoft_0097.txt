Gradivus 3 so called either from gradior, ‘⁴ to stalk as a warrior-,³³
οηιέἴίζῖἶιὶδκῗαδάω, “ to brandish.'’ Homer's description corresponds

³¹ Virqinesque Vestae, ξω] He elected four3 Tarquinius Pris-
cus added two more. At the period of their election they could
not be younger than the age of six years, nor older than ten3
a for thirty years, during which time they were bound to officiate,
they could not marry. After the expiration of that time they
might marry.

⁵³ Pontzficem deinde Numam] The pontvffex mamimus is here
meant3 for there were four pontifices at first created, whose
number was afterwards increased. Many copies read Numa, i. e.
Pompilius.

³⁴ Sacra exscripta exsiqnataque, ᾁτ] He gave him a written
and sealed copy of those institutions that concerned all the sacred
rites. Crevier sayS, eaesiqnata means “ bearing the same seal as
the original copy. ''

3⁵ Susciperentur atque curarentur] “Should be attended to
and expiated.'’--There were some prodigies of such a nature as
to be dssregarded-—Some think procurarentur (as this is the

respecting what prodigies should be attended to.''

But Livy’s meaning is directly the opposite to this3 he says that
their dread of laws and punishment was inferior, in its influence
on their conduct, to their regard for good faith and the obligation
of an oath3 and not the contrary, as Crevier says. The
readings and opinions on this passage are various-for proximo
several copies read pro ipso, to make the sentence agree with
what Ovid says, Fast. Β. 1. v, 251.

Proque metu populum sine vi pudor ipse regebat.

Others have propulso for proximo.

³⁹ Quum ipsi se homines . . . . formarent, ium finitimi] Quum,
when followed by its corresponding tum, usually governs an
indicative3 sometimes, however, a subjunctive.—See B. 3. c. 34.
