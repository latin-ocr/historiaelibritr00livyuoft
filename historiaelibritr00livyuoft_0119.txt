No‘rns To Boon 1. c. 43.Ἰ 101

cornicines tubicinesque include others, and mean all the musical
performers of the army, which were divided into thre: centuries.
Tibicines, “fifers,” is the common reading, which is wrong, as
there were no fifers in the Roman army. Dionysius calls them
σαλπισταί.

⁴¹ censebatur] ‘⁶ Was rated at.”

⁵ Tribus ab Romula] i. e. “ Out of ” the three. Gronovius
says we should read e tribus, Salmasius (de milit. Rom. e. 20,)
understands the words as meaning “in addition'’ to the three

, centuries of Romulus.

⁶ Iisdem . . . . nominibus] They were called Rhamnenses primi
ο et secundi ; Tutienses primi et secundi ,- Luceres primi et secundi.

⁷ Ad equos emendos dena millia oeris ex publico datm] “ Ten
thousand asses.'' It is incredible, according to Walker, that
each horseman, as all the Commentators imagine, got such a
considerable sum, as this must be at this time, to purchase a
horse. Livy himself, B. 4. c. 45, calls this sum divitiae at a
time when money was in much greater abundance. From a
calculation of the value of money, he thinks it more probable
that such a sum was given to each century.

⁸ Et, quibus equos alerent, viduoe attributae, quoe bina millia
oeris in sinqulos annos penderent] “ Widows were appointed to
pay every year two thousand pounds weight of brass, by means of
which the horsemen might support their horseS.''—-Drakenborch
says, this means that the widow’s tax formed a sort of fund, out
of which each horsemau every year got two thousand asse33 not
that each widow paid so much every year, as this would be an
enormous severity.--Gronovius thinks qui would be better here
than quibus.—No doubt, qui here would be very good to express
the “means‚'' as grammarians say, if there were the authority
of respectable MSS. for it

⁹ Inde primae classis centuriae] “After these the eighty
centuries of the first class were called on.” The knights belonged
to these.

¹⁰ Ibi si variaret . . . . ua] “ If there occured a difference of
opinion among these, the practice was, that those of the second
class should be called.'' But if the eighteen centuries of knights,
and the eighty centuries of the first class were unanimous, as
these constituted the maj0rity, it was unnecessary to poll any
more. Sigonius says ut here depends on qradus facti above.

¹¹ Nec mirari oportet, hunc ordinem] ·“ Nor should we be
surprised at this arrangement, which subsists at present, now
that the tribes have been increased to thirty-five, and the original
number of them doubled, does not correspond with the centuries
of senior and junior, according to the amount of those instituted
by Servius Tullius.’' Servius made four city tribeS‚ or districts,
denominated from the different quarters of the city which were
inhabited, i. e. the Palatine, Suburran, Collinian, and Esqui-
