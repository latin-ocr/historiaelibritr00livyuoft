9' In servitutem assereret] “ Το demand the girl as a slave,
and not submit to those who may claim an action in favour of
liberty.” Asserere in servitutem, asserere in libertatem, (see next ’
ch.) were phrases used to signify “to claim one as 3 slave, to
claim one as free.’' Vindiez‘ae was a suit entered into by a person
who claimed the possession of any thing either for himself or
another3 a sort of action of rescue. Vindia-ias decernere, or
dare secundam crin libertatem, “to rule the claim in favour of
liberty,’' secundam or in servitutem, “to rule in favour of slavery,”
were phrases by which was meant, that the subject of the action
should remain “free'' or “in slaver5‚” until the question was
finally decided.—- Vindiez'as dare or decernere, was applied to the
judge who made such 3 decision. Vindieias postulare, was ap-
plied to the plaintiff called assertor, who demanded such 3 deci-
sion. Vindicias dicere ab libertate, was the same as vindicias iu
servitutem dare. Crevier says that vindiciae sometimes means the
temporary possession of a thing pending the aetion.

suqqerit, aut praesentiam suam injudicio commodat amico.

²³ De liberis dimicare] “ Run the hazard of losing his ehil-
dren.” This verb properly means ‘⁶ to combat ;'' hence it comes
often to signify “to encounter danger, to run 3 risk;” here it
is the same as periculum adire below. See 3 similar use of it,
B. 2. c. 12. n. 13. -B. 1 c. 15, inclusi de tectis moenibusque dimi-
carent. ——See also e. 48. n. 45.
