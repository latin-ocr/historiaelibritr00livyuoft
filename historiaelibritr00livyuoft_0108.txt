the sense of unicus.

'⁴ Jom‘ Elicio] Ab elicio, i. e. evoco ,· praefatis enim quibas-
dam votis Jovem coelo elici posse putabant. But Plutarch says it

B. 2. c. 2. ¹⁷ The epithet maz-imus is not found applied to him
earlier than in B. 3. c. 24. In some copies, however, the epithet
maximum is used here. The word is derived from pons and facio, as
they were the persons who first built, and afterwards kept in repair,
the pons sublicius, or wooden bridge built over the Tiber. Posse
and facere is another derivation, as they were thought the only
priests who could sacrifice, facere being sometimes particularly
applied to the performance of sacred rites, as Virg. Ecl. faciam
vitulo't.

’Β Medium erat in Anco inqenz'um, ige] ‘⁸ The genius of Ancus
was of a middle kind, partaking both of the disposition of Numa
and Romulus3 and, besides his believing that peace was more
necessary in the reign of his grandfather than in his own, as the
people were then newly incorporated and barbarouS, he also
(believed) that he himself could not easily, without submitting
to injuries, maintain the tranquillity which had fallen to the
others lot3 that his patience was tried, and, when tried, was
despised: and that the times were fitter for a king like Tullus
than Numa.'’ The structure of this sentence is somewhat com-
plicated and obscure. Repeat credebat with etiam.
