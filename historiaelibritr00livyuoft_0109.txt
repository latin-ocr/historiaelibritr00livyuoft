NoTns To Boon 1. c. 32. 91

⁸¹ Jus descripsit] “He copied, or bom-owed the form.'’ Jus
is “ the legal and established form or ceremony” used in doing any
thing3 carmen, a few sentences after, is “ the language or words”
used in going through it.

⁸⁵ Capite velato filo (lanae velamen est).] “ His head being
covered with a thread (the covering is of wool).’' So Tibull, L. l.
Eleg. 3, velatus filo, and Virg. AEn. 5. 366, vittis velatus. Velare
is used to signify “ to cover the head with chaplets, fillets, gar-
lands, &a in sacrifice.'' Some read filum, and connect it with lanoe.

⁸⁵ Fas-,J The divine law, which was violated by the aggres-

sors,

‘³⁷ Dedier . . . . siria] For dedi and siveris. There is another
reading—dedier populo Romano mihi, “to be given up to me,
the representative of the Roman people.”

⁸⁸ Si non deduntur, quos exposcit] Scil. quos homines dedi ez·-
poscz't,· he uses here the more worthy gender, as grammarians
say3 as he had said before, illos homines illasque res dedier.
Duker would prefer quoe, which would include persons and
things.

⁸⁹ solennes sunt] So many are allowed by established rule,
before war is proclaimed.

⁹⁰ Cum his nuncius redit] “ He returns with this news.''

⁹¹ Quarum rerum, litium, causarum, condixit] “With respect
to the matterS, controversies‚ and arguments about which the
pater patratus of the Romans negociated with the pater patratus,
&c.'' These genitives are a Graecism, where ἕνεκα, is often un-
derstood. donalia-it, “treated with,'' alludes to the negotiation
about the breaeh of the league, and the demand of the restitu-
tion, which was rejected. As it was the pat. patr. who ratified
the truce, it is naturai he should be the person sent to complain
of its violation‚ and require redress 3 though Livy does not men-
tion the pater pat. of the Latins, we must suppose he was the
person to treat with the Roman pat. patr„ who is styled loqutus
above. Gronovius and Crevier imagine that condixit means
“ entered into a covenant with,'' and that it alludes to the league
entered into between the two states, and ratified by the pater
patr. of each, whose proper office it was to make peace. They
think the king consulted the senate only about the violation of
the league, and not the refusal of restitution.

⁹⁹ Consentio eonseiscoque] “ I am of opinion that they should
be sought by fair and holy combat, and consent and vote with
those who think so.'' Crevier says the words consentio conscisco-
que allude to the consent given by the senate to the people,
whose business, he says, it was to declare war3 but it does not
appear the people were at all consulted, as Walker‚ I think,
well observes.

’Β Bellum erat eon-emm] “ War was declared by common con-
sent,” i. e. the vote of the majority was as effeetual as if all
