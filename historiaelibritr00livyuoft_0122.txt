’⁰ Ex templa] “ 0111 of the temple? Extemplo, “ imme-
diately‚” would be a better reading, though ex templo is often used
in this sense. When the sacrifice was over, the priest uttered
1110 words ez· templo, which was a signal for the people to retire3
in the same way, whefi the business of the court was over, the
crier pronounced ilicet (ire licet ς) and as the people all at once
retired, the words came to signify “ at once.'' Some think that,
as templum means “ a place marked out by the augur for taking
his omenS,'' ex templo is the same as ilico, scil. ἒ loco.

³¹ Immolat] This properly means “ to sprinkle meal mixed
with salt on the head of the victim‚” which was the ceremony by
which 11 was consecrated to the gods; hence 11 signifies “to
sacrifice,” and 13 general “ to slay.'' It comes from in and mola,
“ meal mixed with salt.”

CHAP. XLV1.-⁸² Usu haud dubium reqnum possederat]
“ Though he had now an undoubted title to the kingdom 13 con-
sequence of his possession of it.'’ The Romans considered that
possession for a certain time gave a right. So Horace, Ep. 2. B.
2. 159, quadam mancipat usus. Some read dubie for dubium.

³³ Affectandi requi] “ Of seizing on the sovereign power.”
So, Virg. AEn. 3. 670, ubi nulla datar affectare dextra potestas.
So 13 English we. say “ affected with disease, affected with
melancholy,‘’ or the like.

³⁴ De aqro plebis adversa patrum voluntate senserat aqi]
“ He was sensible, that the business of distributing' the land
among the populace, was opposed by the wishes of the patricians.”
Adversd......v0luntate is an abl. absolute. Most old copies and
MSS. read adversum (some, adversas) patrum voluntatem—But
the adjective adversus is often 01033311)ν used by Livy and others
to form an ablative absolute.

³⁵ Et Romana reqia] ‘⁴ The palace of the Roman kings too (as
well as that of other kings) presented an instance of tragic atrocity.”

³⁶ filius neposne...ediclerim.] Dionysius, arguing from the long
reigns of Ancus, Tarquinius Priscus, Servius and Tarquinius
Superbus, says he was his grandson3 but this reasoning is over-
thrown by Newton in his chronology. Ediderz‘m, “ I may or can
have pronounced him ;'' the same as ede-re licet. An is under-
stood afterfilius ; the omission of this particle an after a word,
when ne is joined to a following word to which the preceding is
opposed, is often met with. So B. 9, c. 32, Etrusci diem primum
consultando, maturarent traherentne bellum, traduxerunt.

³⁷ Nupserant] This word is properly applied to a woman,
and strictly means “ to put 03 1110 bridal veil.'' Ducere uxorem
(to lead home his wife) was applied to the man.

³⁸ Fortuna] Because the marriage of two such violent spirits
would accelerate the king⁷s death, which would be 33 injurious

event to the state, before his measures were established, and a
taste for freedom given.
