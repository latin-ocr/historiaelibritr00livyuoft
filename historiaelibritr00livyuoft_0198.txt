⁷ Fovit] “Nurtured.” A metaphor bom-owed from the ir».-
sensible growth of trees, say some commentators.

⁹ Deminutumfl Deminuere is simply “ to reduee,” “ to lessen
by taking off a part ;'' but diminuere is “ to make a thing smaller
by breaking it into pieees.’' However, the words are often
confounded. Diminutum is another reading.

⁹ Omnia insiqnia] Except the crown and sceptra—See B.
3. c. 36. n.

¹⁰ Primoribus equestris qradzls lectis ad trecentorum summam]
“ To the full number of three hundred senators.’' This was the
regular number of senators fixed by Tarquinius Priscus—See
B. 1. ch. 35. note 24. By the tyranny of Tarquin the Proud they
were reduced to one hundred and thirty-six. The number of
three hundred lasted, with small variation, to the age of Sylla.
In the time of J. Caesar they amounted to nine hundred. Augus-
tus reduced them to six hundred. It is not certain at what time

(but by these words it must have been before this) the equites, ⁴

or those who were originally the cavalry, called also celer-ex, be-
came a. distinct order under the state. Perhaps it was under
Ser. Tullius-See B. 1. c. 43. After the order became established,
all those, who served on horseback, were not properly called
equites, or “knights,” but only those who were elected into it,
and presented with a horse at the public expense, and with a
gold ring, whjch· they always wore. Their tunic was ornamented
in front with a line or stripe of small purple studs or buttons,
anqusti clavi, and was thence called anqustielavus, or tunica
anqusticlava, to distinguish it from the senator’s tunic, called
lafielavus, because it had a similar ornament, but much broader.
According to a law proposed by L. Roscius Otho, A. U. 686,
they sat at the theatre and all the public shows behind the or-
chestra (which was the place set apart for the senators) on four..
teen seats3 hence the phrases annulo aureo, or equo donari,
sedere in quatuordecim, spectare in equite, signified to hold the
rank of knight. They were chosen promiscuously from the
patricians and plebeians. Those of them, who were descended
from noble families, were distinguished by the epithets of illustre-e,
splendidi, speciosi. The age requisite for election was about
eighteen years 3 hence. they were called juvenes and adolescentes ,-
and they should possess a certain fortune, which, towards the end
of the republic, and under the emperors, should be 400 sestertia,
(that of the senators being 1200,) or about- AE3‚230. After the
appointment of censors, the election was usually made by them.
At first their office was to serve in the army, but afterwards they
acted as judges or jury-men3 (see B. 3. c. 24. n.) and were
mostly the persons who farmed the public revenues, publicani,
vectigalium conductores. Every year, on the 15th of July, they
all rode in processioa (called transvectio) from the temple of
Mars, outside the city, to the capitol 3 and every fifth year. on
