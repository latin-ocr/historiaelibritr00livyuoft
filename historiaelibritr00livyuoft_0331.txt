the plebeians.'' So completely alike were the efforts of all.
Nemo unus, like Romanus nemo, c. 60.

¹⁸ Placidius] ‘⁴ Showed greater meekness of disposition.”
Quietius, “greater quietness of eonduet.”
¹⁹ Ades-ea] “ Stood by them ;” became their advocates. The

word is often taken in this sense—See B. 3. c. 44.-B. 4. c. 8.
—Hor. Sat. 9. B. 1.

²⁰ Alibi] On other occasions.

²¹ Tranquillo] “And the tribunes not only carried their
other measures in quietness .’' Tranquillus is properly applied
to things, as, mare tranquillum, “a sea not disturbed by tempest50”
It has a meaning purely passive, and is not applied to the body.
Quietus has both an active and passive meaning, and is applied
ωΞθῖῧὲἲῗὶέᾳῖἓὲωῗῗῂΐῗῇζὼουέ one offensive expression, much
less any violence being used.'' It would, say some, be much
better to connect these words with the preceding clause, and
have a full stop at fieret. But, by understanding sed before
paullatim, the present reading is quite natural.-See B. 1.
c. 25. n. 82.

Β ᾸΙαηευιςῇῑεετ-αηῂ] Scil. juvenes patricii.

CHAP. XV.—²⁴ Ferendus] The tribunes “ proposed,'' the
people ‘⁵ received,” the law.

²⁵ Quantam] This is often used for quanto, as here.—See B.
5- c. 10.

²⁰ Statum] “ A war from the AEqui and Volsci, which became
now a stated one, and returned regularly almost every year,
was a subJect of apprehension.'’

⁸¹¹ Quinqenti] For quinqentos. Livy often writes thus3 80
Horace uses duo for duos-5 Hor. Sat. B. l. 7.

²⁸ Caedes eorum] It is more likely that these were the inhabi-
tants of the Capitoline Hill, than the guards of the capitol.
Dionysius expressly says they were3 and Livy himself, B. 6. c.
20, and 5. c. 50, says these parts were inhabited. Arce here
means “ the hill.”

²⁹ Incerto hosta] “ Not knowing who the enemy was? more
’ literally, “the enemy not being accurately known.”——So Sall.
Jug. e. 49, incerti, quidnam esset. This word, in the next sen-
tence, and indeed generally, has a different meaning.

⁸⁰ Ad opportuna] ‘⁶ In proper places through all the city.”
omnis is often put for totus. '

⁸² Servitiis] For servis. So we find remiqium for remiqes ,-
ministerium for ministri ,· erqastula for servi ,· advocatio for
advocati5 dominatio sor domini ,· operoe for operarii ; and the
like. So, in Greek, we find digamia for θεράποντες.

CnAP. XV1.-³⁸ Venirent] This and adessent depend on ne
above—N. B. For ‘¹ next reference, read ⁸⁸.

θ’ Cui nec θηρίον-8.] “ Whom it was neither safe to trust, nor,
