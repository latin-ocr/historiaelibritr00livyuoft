vi LIFE or LIVY.

of Sylla, Caesar, Labienus, Pollio, AugustuS, and many
others, which were then extant, and traced from their
remotest origin, with nice and scrutinizing accuracy, the
progress of things through all their wide and varied
diversions. This irreparable loss has been deplored by
the world.

I own, says Bolingbroke, that I should be glad to
exchange what we have of this history, for what we
hav-e not. The authors, from which he drew his infor-
mation, were Fabius Pictor, the oldest of the Roman
writerS, Macer Licinius, ancl Q. TuberO, among the
Latins; and Polybius among the Greeks.. He also
made frequent mention of libra· lintei. Asinius Pollio, a
writer of the Augustan age, says thatin hjs writings there
was what he calls Putat-initas. What the precise mean-
ing of this expression is has not been well ascertained3
but most persons imagine that it means a provincial and
impure peculiarity of diction. However, Pollio appears
to stand alone in his opinion. The objections made to
his frequent introduction of long speeches, a charge to
which all the writers of antiquity are as liable as Livy,
of prodigies and superstitious stories, which were un-
avoidable in the history of a superstitious and credulous
people‚ and his partiality to his countrymen, particularly
Scipio Africanus, and Pompey, are so futile, that it is
unnecessaiw to dwell on the subject. All posterity have
subscribed to the opinion of Quinctilian, who thus-
pronounces on him: ‘⁶ . . . . quum in narrando mirae
jucunditatis clarissimique canderis, tum in concionibus,
supra quam enarrari potest, , ele-quentem.’'——B. 10. c.⁴ l.
