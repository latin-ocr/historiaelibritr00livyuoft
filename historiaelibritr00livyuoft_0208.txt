¹⁷ Attonitus] “ This properly means “ thunderstruck,” ren-
dered powerless by a stroke of lightning 3 hence “ stupified.’'

¹⁸ Juberem macte virtute esse] “ I would bid you increase or
prosper in bravery.’' Macte, from maqis auetuS, is a vocative
ease, or an interjection formed from it. The phrase macte virtute,
or, virtutis, as it is sometimes in poetry, is used in praising,
congratulating, or exhorting one; the word is sometimes plural,
macti—See B. 7. e. 36. Some insert te here3 some reject esse.

¹⁹ Jure belli liberum] “Released from the law of war,'’ or
the consequences of that 1aw3 i. e. from the punishment, which
by the laws of war Ι could inflict on you as an enemy. So B.
4. e. 33, liberisroenis equi—See B. 1. c, 1. n. 20.

²⁰ Ut cuique ceciderit primo, quoad te opportunum fortuna
dederit] “ The rest, according as it shall have fallen to each
man’s lot first, (i. e. before the rest of his associates,) shall be
with you, each at his proper time, until fortune, on some favour-
able opportunity, shall have given you into their power.” Primo
is by many considered faulty. Another reading is utcunque
ceciderit primo, which is thus explained: “ according to the
success that shall attend me, who drew the first lot.” Ι think
the present reading makes good sense. The readings of this
passage are various ; some reading primum ,- some, primi
(genit.), connecting it with the following words3 and some, qu&
for quoad.

CHAP. ΧΙΙΙ.-21 Scoevolae] A left-handed man was called
scaevola from σκαωός, “left.’' Mutius now had only the use of
his left hand.

’Β Quo nihil se ...... texisset] “ From which nothing but the
mistake of the assassin had sheltered him.’' A quo would be
the ordinary style. ⁷

a De aqro Vejentibus restituenda] Dionysius says that
Porsena required this land to be given to himself as arequital
for granting peace. This seems the more probable account, as
Livy himself, ch. 15, says that he gave it back to the
Romans.

²⁴ Expressaque necessitas] Walker says a thing may be said
exprimi necessitate, vi, metu, ‘⁶ to be extorted by necessity, or
sear, or violence ;’' see B. 3. c. 28 and 30, B. 4. e. 553 B. 8. c.
2, et alibi ; but that expressanecessitas, “necessity was extorted,''
is a strange and unclassical phrase, and he proposes expressitque,
i. e. the necessity of giving hostages to the Romans, wrung
them from them.

{⁵ Alias haud maqnz' facere] “The others he set no high
va ue on.''

²⁸ Proe seserre.] “ Openlyndeclaredf'

τ’ Parte obsidum] “Half the hostages.'’—So B. 8. c. 4, et
alibi. In English ‘⁶ share'' is sometimes used in this sense.
