'¹⁹ Adversas valles] In Walker’s edition, and most others, it
is said that the words should 110, aversas valles, “the valleys
which lay, ὰ ter-qo, behind them ;'’ for that the front of the camp
was towards the Romans, and in a direction opposite the valleys.
But 1 think that adversas is fully intelligible. It is said the posi-
tion 1135 3 11111, and a very secure one, munitissimis locis ; no men-
tion 15 1113ᾶο of its being fortified by art 3 it must theu be fortified ἡ

Now, when the Romans had gained possession of the hill, the
AEqui 11010 50 astounded at the desperate boldness of the act,
that they dashed (101111 1110 precipices in different directions into

iu order to save themselves. We cannot suppose that in their
consternation they all took oue direction3 therefore he uses the
word calles, “ valle3·s‚” which word must embrace more direc-
tions than one. But if he meant that they 311 took “ one’' way,
i. e. on the “rear’' of the camp down to the low ground, he
would probably have used the singular, vallem ; as 11011, 011 0110

versas may be taken, as it often is, to signify au opposite direc-
11011 to the Romans, and this would amount to what aversas would

div idual authoritv 15 1101 enough to change it.

⁸⁰ Ubi satis pradum] In Walker’s edition aud others, it is
said that the reading should be ibi, 35 1110 word alludcs to the
camp, and not to the valleys. This alteration appears unne-
cessary. 11η· very often is considered rather as an adverb
of time and circumstances, than of place, signifying “ thereupon,
111011, δεο.” We bave instauees of it, ch. 20, ibi (then) alia—
coorta puqna ; ch. 35, ibi ira est suppressa, and several other
places3 so ubi, which is here the reading of almost all MSS„
and 15 1110 relative of ibi, often implies time and circumstance
rather thau place, and signifies (35 11010) “ whereupon,'’ ‘⁵ ou
which occasion,'’ or “ by which means.”--See F acciolati’s Lexi-
con, Omnis Latinitatis. The reading of most MSS. and old
copies is, ubi satis praedae ez· victoria, ᾂο. i. e. says Draken-
borch, considering their bloodless victory, they got booty enough.
