mother, after the death of AEneaS, fied through sear of Ascanius
to the woods, when pregnant, to the protection of the shepherd
Tyrrhenus3 and that this Sylvius, after the death of Ascanius,
was raised by the people to the throne of Alba to the exclusion
of Iulus. Observe the idiom, quem Iulum eundem, for idem quem.

⁴⁶ Ut tum res erant] It was a flourishing city, considering
the barbarous condition of those places at that time3 he does
not mean that it was in a more flourishing condition then than
after.

⁴¹⁷ Sub Albano monte] i. e. The mountain, which, from this
city, was afterwards called Albanus mons. Sub here, I think,
means “ close by, at the foot of,’' as AEn. 5. 323, sub ipso volat

. Diores. There were a number of little hills at the foot of this

mountain, called Albani tumuli, on the ridge of one of which this
city was built3 it was not built on what was properly termed
Mons Albanus, as most commentators seem to think.

⁴³ Dorso] This means the ridge of a hill, or any long and
elevated body. Virgil applies the word to a hjgh wave. It was
called lonqa from its situation on this hill3 why it was called alba
is uncertain. Virgil says it was from a white sow found there
by AEneas. ⁴

⁴⁹ Inter Lavinium et Albam Lonqam coloniam [seductam] i. e.
There was an interval of about thirty years between the building
of Lavinium and the leading out of the colony to found Alba.

⁵⁰ Fluvius Albula, quem] Quem here refers to fluvius ,· quam,
referring to Albula, is another reading.

⁵¹ Coloniae] These colonies, that were sent out, were called
prisci Latini ,- the ordinary style would be appellatae.'’

⁵² Mansit Syll-iis postea omnibus coqnomen] The name of
Sylvius continued with an the subsequent kings of Alba. So B.
1. c. 7, Trojae loco nomen est—c. 39, puer0, cui Servio Tullio
nomen fuit—c. 49, cui Superbo nomen facta indiderunt—c. 50,
Superbo inditum Romoe coqnomen—B. 2. c. 16, Attus Clausus, cui
postea Appio Claudio suit Romae nomen. Sylvius is the reading
of several MSS. and most old editions. Sylvium, taken adjec-
tively to agree with nomen, is the reading of Lipsius and others;
but Gronovius says, that though a proper name may be so joined
to nomen, when nomen means the name of a “ family'’or “ clan,'’ as B.
1. c. 47, nomen Tarquinium, B. 2. c. 42, Fabium nomen, it can-
not, when nomen means the name of “ an individual.'’

⁵³ Celebre ad posteros nomem] The new name (the Tiber)
was the name that was celebrated in after ages.

⁵⁴ Per manus] In the regular order of succession3 from
hand to hand, as we say.

⁵⁵ Verecundia ectasis] “ Reverence due to age,’' ἱ. e. to his
priority of birth.

⁵⁶ Per v,suver-iem honoria] “ Under the pretext of conferring
honour on her.''
