¹¹¹ Pro consula] This is the first mention made in Livy of a
proconsul.

CHAP. V.—¹¹⁵ Decumami porta] The Roman camp was gene-
rally square, and had four gates; one in front of the enemy
called praetoria, as it was near the praetorium, or general’s tent3
this was also called extraordinaria ,⁴ see Β. 40. e. 273 two on the
sides, right and left, called principales ,· see B. 34. c. 463 one at
the rere called quaestoria, because, in the early agea, the questo-
rium, or quaestor’s tent, was near it; see B. 10. e. 32.—B. 34. c.
273 this was also called decumana, because the tenth cohorts,
decimae cohortes, were quartered there. There were generally
many legions together in one camp in the first ages3 in after-
times each legion often encamped separately. Every legion was
divided into ten cohorts. The first eohorts of these several
legions were quartered near the praetorium, so called from the
title of praet-or, or commander, which was a name at first
given to the consul, as he was commander of the army3 after-
wards it was given to the magistrate appointed to discharge the
judieial functions of the consul. Then behind these first eohorts,
in regular order of succession, were quartered all the others to the
tenth or last, which were quartered in the extreme rere of the
camp. In aftertimes the quoestorium was on one side of the prae-
tortum ,· and on the other side, the tents of the general officers.
Near the quaestorium was the forum or market-plaee. The camp
was divided into two parts, the upper and the lower, which were
separated by a broad open space, called principia, running the
breadth of the camp, and lying directly between the portae prin-
cipales, which derived that name from it.. In this the general’s
tribunal was erected3 the tribunes of the soldiers held their
courts, and punishments were inflicted. The principal stand-
ards also, and the altars of the godS, stood there. In the lower
part of the camp most of the army was quartered, the cavalry
occupying the middle. In each tent there were usually ten
soldiers, called contubernales. Every camp had eight roads or
passages, five running from front to rear, and three from side
to side3 besides by-ways, and spaces between the tents. See
Lipsius on the Roman Art of War.

’Β Nec spe nec viribus pares] Unequal in hope and strength,
to what they were, when besieged the first time.

ὀ Pereqrz‘nis copiis] These words are put in apposition
with Latino Hernicoque exercitu, which should either be written
before pereqrinis copiis, or must have been an interpolation of
some transcriber, because peregrinis copiis and Latino Hernicoque
exercitu are identical expressions, as appears from the preceding
chapter. The transposition of cum would fully remove the diffi-
culty, that commentatore speak of here, by reading either
pereqrz'nis cum copiis, or eum pereqrinis copiis.

³¹ Simul ad siquam] “ At the same time a sally being made
from the camp on a signal given by himself at a distance.”
