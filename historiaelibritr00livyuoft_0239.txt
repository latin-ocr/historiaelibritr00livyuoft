was highcr than the ring through which their necks were thrust.
In the heroic ages the “ draught'’ (as we say,) was on the head,
not on the breast and shoulderS, the traee or band coming· round
the forehead.

⁶ Fabii coesi ad unum] i. e. Q. Fab. Vibulanus, son to M.
F ab„ who was consul ten years asten—See Β. 3. c. 1. Diony-
sius thinks it very unlikely that he should be the only survivor.
Walker imagines that the belief, that he was so, originated in the
fact, that he was the only surviving son of the three brothers of
consular rank, and that from him were descended the famous
, Fabii of after times.

⁷ Stirpem . . . futurum] “Who was the stock to propagate
the Fabian family, and to prove even the greatest support, &c.”

CHAP. L1.—⁸ Clades esset] Crevier thinks the word should
be est ,· but this, Walker says, would destroy Livy’s meaning,
which is, that these entered on their consulship after the disaster
happened. He says, Livii verba innuunt Horatium et Menenium
non ante consulatum iniisse, quam clades hoec accepta fuit. But
surely Walker must have seen that Livy asserts, next ch., that
Menenius was consul at that time.

*³ Super bellum annona* premente] “A scarcity of provisions
distressing them in addition to the war.”

¹⁰ Ad Spei sit aeqzco Marte] “ At the temple of Hope‚” which
was one mile from the city AEdem or templum is often sup-
pressed. So, B. 1. c. 41, ad Jovis Statoris—B. 2. c. 7, ubi nunc
Vicoepotoe est—B. 3. c. 48, prope Cloacinoe ; et alibi. Dionysius,
B. 9, says that the Romans were the conquering party here.

¹¹ Parvo momenta] “By but a triffing advantage.’' See B.
1. c. 47. n. 51.—B. 2. c. 7. n. 70.

¹² Proximam puqnae cladem] See c. 50. n. 93.

¹⁸ Velut ab arce Janz'culz'.] From the Janiculum, as if it were
their fortress.

¹⁴¹ Secuti dedita operti . . . proecipitavere in insidias] “Pur-
suing some cattle which were intentionally driven out in every
direction to decoy them, they fell into an ambuscade.'’ Praeei-
pitare is sometimes used in this sense. See B. 5. 18.—B. 6. 30.
So Plaut. Trinumm. 2. l. 30.

qui in amorem
Praecipitavit, pejus perit, quam si saxo saliat.

¹⁵ Plures] More numerous than the Fabii.

¹⁶ Qued inopia frumenti, quamvis in praecipitia, 0¹⁶] “Because
want of provisions drove him to adopt plans, however rash,
provided they were expeditious, he marched his army, at all
hazards, up the Janieulum, which lay opposite to him.’'—See ch.
31. n. 79. It would appear from this, that the Janiculum at this
time was detached from the city. Dionysius expressly states, that
it was two miles from it3 and when Livy, B. 1. e. 33, sayS, that
Ancus added it to the city, we must only suppose that he merely

sortified it, or drew a line of communication between it and the
