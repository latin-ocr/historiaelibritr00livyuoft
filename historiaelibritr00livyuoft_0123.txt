NOTES 'ro BOOK 1. c. 46, 47. 105

⁸⁹ Muliebri cessaret audacia] “Wanted that daring enter
prise which a woman ought to have.” She imagined that this
was a necessary qualification in a woman, as she herself pos-
sessed it. Cesso sometimes means “to be free from‚'’ “to
want ;” so Lucan, cessare Marte cruento ; scil. ὰ Marte cruento.

⁴⁰ Sed initium] Though they both possessed such congeni-
ality of sentiment, yet the woman was the first to begin the
disturbance. Such is the force of sed.

⁴¹ De viro acl fratrem] “About her own husband to his
brother, about her sister to her (sister’ s) husband?

⁴² Viduam] This word is sometimes, as here, applied to a
woman who never married. So virqo sometimes means “ a.
married woman.' Hor. Od. B. 2, Od. 8. 22, miseraeque nuper
virqines nuptae. See also B. 3. Od. 11. 35.

⁴³ Aruns Tarquinius et Tullia minor prope continuatis funeribus
quum domos vacuas novo matrimonio fecissent, junquntur nuptiis-,J
“When Aruns Tarquinius and the younger Tullia had by their
deaths, which happened almost in succession, left their houses free
for a new marriage, they (Lucius Tarquinius, and the elder Tullia)
are united in matrimony, Servius rather not preventing, than
approving of, the match.'' Dionysius says that the elder Tullia
was the first wife of Lucius Tarquinius. Whence Sabellicus,
Glareanus, and others, would read here Tullia major. Accord-
ing to this first explanation of the passage, the two verbs fecis-
sent and junquntur, though apparently united in sense, must have
different subjects. Such a peculiarity occurs elsewhere in Livy,
where the subject of one of two verbs, (generally the latter verb)
thus apparently connected, is supplied from the context, as c.
4, sacerdos vincta in custodiam datur ,· pueros in profluentem
aquam mitti jubet, scil. rea· jubet—B. 2. c. 28, correpti con-
sules quum, quid erqo se facere vellent, percunctarentur, decernunt
ut, &a scil. patres decernunt—B. 4. c. 48, prensantur ὰ priuci-
pibus tribuni ...... sex ad intercessionem comparavere, scil. princi-
pes senatorum. Lucius Tarquinius et Tullia minor is another
reading sanctioned by almost all MSS. 3 and, according to this, the
translation is, “ after Lucius Tarquinius and the younger Tullia
had by their murders, which happened almost in succession,
(one by the murder of 1115ι sife, the elder Tullia3 ‘the other by
the murder of her husband, Aruns Tarquinius) made their 11011663ἑ
open for a new marri age, they are then joined in matrimony.
This is the more probable reading, as the phrase facere domos
vacuas novis nuptiis is applied rather to the‘ ‘murderers’⁷ than
the “murderedss’ So Ci c. Catil ]. e 6, eum morte superioris
uxoris domum vacuam novis nuptiis fecisses.—Sall. Catil. c. 15,
pro certo creditur, necato filio, domum vacuam scelestis nuptiis
emese.
f CHAP. XLVIL—4⁴¹ Infestior senectus] ‘⁶ More hated.” This
word is sometimes used in an active, sometimes, as here, in a

passive sense.
