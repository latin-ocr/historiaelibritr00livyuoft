quite common3 so B. 4. c. 4, ut homimem, ut civium, numero
simus. Various other corrections and explanations of the pas—
sage are proposed.

⁶⁶ Qua] “With which they commenced their games by
visiting us with ignominy.'' Gronovius and Crevier would prefer
qui, scil. Romani, as (c. 18,) qui, si maxime} esc ecifamilz‘ci.

⁶⁷ Traductos per ora hominum] He uses this form of ex-
pression to rouse them the more, as it was properly applied to
captives, who were led in triumph before the face of the people.

⁶⁸ Piaculum merituri] “And do what would deservo an ex-
piation on our part.” The expiation or atonement to the gods
should be made, not by the Romans, but the offending Volscians.
Mereor often means “to earn,'' ‘⁶ to deserve by his conduct any
evil to one's self ;'' in malam soepe sumitur partem, say the gram·
marians. So iu English we say “to earn or deserve a curse,
misery, punishment, &c.'’

ω Non fuya] “And not a ffight⁹⁹ from our enemies, as it
ought rather be called

⁷⁰ Et incitati] “ And incited by Tullus.’'

CHAP. XXXIX-⁷1 Quam spem nequaquam fifillit] Sigo-
nius and others would read quae spes ; this form of expression
is equally classical.

'¹² Tramyressus] He did not march towards Rome in a direct
line, but turned across the country to the Latin road.

⁷³ Novella laea] “These newly-acquired possessions.²’—See
ch. 33. The common reading makes this Novella, a town3 thus,
Novellam, hoec Romanis, (ξἐ. The elder Gronovius would read
Bovillas, koec, ᾅε. ,· the younger, Muqz’llam, ἠως, ‘5⁴0-

⁷4 Recepit] Drakenborch and Doujatius say that this means,
“took under his protection ;’' for, as Lavinium was never subject
to the Volscians, the word cannot mean, as it generally does,
“retook or recovered.'' But, says Walker, may not the word
here, as elsewhere, mean simply “made himself master of ?’'
It is taken in this sense, Β. 3. c. 29, eastris hostium receptis.
Lavinium was subject to the Romans. Some verbs compounded
with re are, no doubt, often taken for their simples, as Sall. Jug.
Preface, nunc ad inceptum redeo. So, Caes. Bell. Gall. Labi-enus
civitatem recepit. Dionysius and Plutarch say he only besieged it.

⁷⁵ Cluilias] See B. 1. c. 33.

⁷⁵ Id modo non conveniebat] “In this point alone they did
not agree, that the senate, &c.'' Most copies and MSS. have
sicut alias after modo‘.

⁷⁷ Sp. Nautium] Dionysius mentions two pairs of consuls
before these. ΙΠ the year 264, when the games were disap-
proved of by the gods (see c. 36.) he says Q. Sulpicius and Sp.
Lartius were consuls3 and in the following year, when they were
renewed, he mentions C. Julius and P. Pinarius3 and it appears
that Livy himself, B. 3. c. 30, has taken these into acccount.
