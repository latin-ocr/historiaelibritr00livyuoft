See B. 4. c. 59. n. for more instances.
Δ ⁵ In ducentos amplias post suam aetatem] ‘⁶ Which was to last
for two hundred years longer after his time.’'

⁶ Divendendci proedcl quadraqinta talenta arqenti (murique) re-
cepisset] “ When he had reserved (or saved) forty talents of

silver by the sale of the plunder.'’ Some read dividenda—qw-
drinqenta. But it is not likely that he distributed this immense sum

among his soldiers. Aurique in the text is considered as spurious.
Dionysius, B. 4. p. 251, says, the sum was four hundred talents
of silver, which was the tithe of the whole plunder—w) δὲ τοῖς
θεοῖς δεκατεῦἐεν ἀργύριον τετρακοσίων οὐ μενὲν γένεσθαι τάλαντον. This
appears to be a prodigious sum in those days, particularly as being
the tenth of the spoils of one small town. Refimisset, which
Brisson shows often means the same as colliqere, is a ver-y
common reading—See ch. 55. n. 33.

⁷ obsidendi quoque] Trying it by blockade too, as well as
(vi) by storm.

⁸ Minimus] Dionysius says he was the eldest.

⁹ Frequentiae toedere.] ‘⁶ He was dissatisfied even with the
greatnumber of his own children.’'

¹⁰ Ardor-is aliquid . . . . inventurum] That perhaps he would
find persons, who would not only protect him, but even feel an
ardour to engage in war, ὣς.

¹¹ Morarentur] “ Ifthey should pay him no attention, or de-
tain him.” Moror may signify either. Moverentur is another
reading.

¹² Vetant mirari] “ They bid him not to be surprised·”

¹³ Si alia desim] “ If other obJects for exercising his cruelty
upon failed him.'’

CHAP. LIV.-¹⁴ Ubi, quum de aliis rebus assentire] “ After
that he was admitted to their public eouncils: where, while he
declared that he would submit in other matters to the opinions of
the Gabinian elders, who were better acquainted with them, he as-
sumed to himself the privilege of perpetually recommending war,
and claimed for himself superior knowledge in this, because he
was “acquainted with’' (nosset) the strength of both people, and
“ knew” (sciret) that the tyranny of a king, which even his own
children had been unable to endure, was surely an object of hate
to free citizens.'’ Mark the different use and signification here
of noscere and seire. All that Ι think necessary to say here is,
that noscere, in general, is to know or be “ acquainted with'’ any
thing as an object of preception, as, novi cedes, hominem, vultus,
vires, (572. Novi the perfect denotes present knowledge and past
perception3 though properly referring to substance and its at-
tributes as objeets of perception,yet it sometimes refers metaphori-
cally to any other object apprehended by the mind—Scire is to
know any thing as a. matter of fact, or any truth as an object of
