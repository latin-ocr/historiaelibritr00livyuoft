³⁹ Magfis non confidere, qucim non credere, militibus] i. e.
“ Rather distrusted the valour, than disbelieved the sincerity, of
the soldiersss’ Tln's appears to be the real and obvious meaning
of these word53 yet Nannius, Klockius, and Drakenborch, think-
because Fabius, in the sequel of this chapter, is made to say:
eqo istos posse vincere scio ; velle ne scirem, isti fecerunt—that it
follows that non confidere means, ‘⁶ not to believe their inclination
to fight 3⁹³ and non credere, ‘⁶ not to trust their mmm-,³⁹ But surely
it does not appear that the enemy and the consuls must have ne-
cessarily said, or even thought, the same thing. The enemy say
it was cowardice‚ the consul ascribes it to want of inclination on
the part of the Romans. Each had his own motive for what he

says.

vexare. Virg. AEn. 5, pulsatque versatque Dareta.

⁴⁸ Nolle successum, non, ifle] “ They wished not success either

They were also called principes ordinum, or primi ordines, or

⁵⁰ Terqiversantur tamen. Fabius deinde] Teryiversatur tamen

⁸¹ Ad crescentem tumultu jam metum seditionis] “As his col-

several MSS„ where some had a comma after tumultu, others, after
seditionis. According to the present reading ad is used for
propter, as it frequently is.
