CRAP. 1.-¹ Ad Cremeram] This event happened ten years
before this time3 see B. 2. c. 50. He was then near the age of
puberty3 so that he had not arrived at the usual age for election
to the consulship3 yet Valerius Corvus was consul at the age of
twenty-three3 (see B. 7. o. 263) Scipio Africanus the elder, at
the age of twenty-eight3 T. Q. Flaminius, before thirty; and Pom-

the camp the army, which was seized with disease.'’ The sen-

⁹ Haud dubia spe] “ With a confident hope that the fame of
his name would reduce the AEqui to peace.'’ Extra ordinem,
synonymous with extra sortem, means “ that no lots were cast for
