language.--See c. 28. n. 40. Might not plebs querebatur, or
the like, be understood before nihil relictum, and its influence
continued?

CHAP. LV111.—⁸⁴ Numero etiam addito-J “We have the au-
thority of Piso that the number also was increased at that time
by the addition of three, as if there were only two before.”
So the commentators explain these obscure words. Additos
tres, which is another reading, and mu'ch the more probable
one, would make the construction plainer.

⁸⁵ Eadem in militia* saevitia] “ The same severity, which Ap-
pius exercised at home, he began to exercise with less restraint
in t‘he camp.’' Odisse, “he began to hate.”

⁸⁵ Se unico consule objecta] That, when he was set up as con-
sul, as the only man able to oppose the power of the tribunes,—’'
So objectus is used B. 4. c. 13. 44. Oppositus is used in a
similar sense in c. 61 of this book.

⁸⁷ Poterat ....... imbiberant] Scil. exercitus.-See B. 3.
c. 38. n. for a similar use of the conjunction. Some read
imbiberat.

⁸³ Sue sponte motam remittere industriam] “ The diligence,
which they would use of their own accord, they would relax,
should he exhort them to work.’' Praesenti, “when he was
present.”

⁸⁹ Nequicquam acerbitate prompti] 5‘ Having tried every
species of severit-y without effect.’'

Cnff. LIX—⁹⁰ Fabium] See c. 43.

”¹ Expressa visu] Then they were obliged to put forth their
strength. The force of these words is, that this effort was
reluctantly made, as it were “wrung‘' from them, and only through
the fear of losing their camp.

⁹² Alit] “ Crevier thinks the word should be alia'; of any
other loss or disgrace, that they may suffer, they were glad, and
were unwilling that their camp should be taken, only because, as
Roman soldiers, that would reflect indelible shame on them.”
This, I think, far a more rational mode of explaining the passage
than Walker’s, who sayS, ni fallor, vulyatum (i. e. alii) defendi
potest. Vulqb milites vinci voluerunt, eosque clades sua nullo
dolore affecit ; quosdam autem alios, etiam qaudiO. Even if this
explanation make common sense, it is not in my opinion war-
ranted by the genius or usage of the Latin tongue, or even by
Livy’s words. Alius in a latter clause of a sentence, implying a
part of a whole, has reference to alius expressed or understood
in the preceding, and expressing the other part3 and the clauses
must be in immediate juxta-position, or evident contrast. (See
B. 3. c. 61. n.) Now where is the preceding clause to which this
alii refers? Or where is the juxta-position or contrast ἱ) Is it
vinci voluit? for there can be no other. Not to say that, inthis case,
alii cannot be joined to voluit, or that there intervene two sen-
