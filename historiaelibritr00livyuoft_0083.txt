hunting parties, soom-ed the forests that were all around them.”
Seqnis, from se, ἰ. e. sine, and qnavus.

⁷⁰ Subsistere] “ Cheoked, resisted 3⁵⁹ so, B. 9. c. 31, Roma-
num nec acies subsistere ullae nec eastra poterant.

'⁸¹ Seria] Their encounters with robbers and wild beasts 3
Ιἴσως, their games and festivals. Some read feriar. Celebrare,
when referred to actions, means to do a thing often and in com-
pany with many others.

CHAP. V.-⁷²² Lupercal hoa] This Lupercal which we cele-
brate even at this day. This usually meant the “ place’' on the
Aventine Hill, sacred to Pan,sometimes called Faunus, the tutelar
divinjty of flocks and their keepers: thus Virgil describes him z

Pan primus calamos cera conjungere plures
Instituit—Pan curat oves oviumque magistros.

So, Hor. B. 1. Od. 17 :—

Faunus et igneam
Defendit aestatem capellis
U>que meis, pluviosque ventos.
§ec vinde} metuung‘colubros*
Nec Martiales haedilia lupos.

Here the word means the “festival” or “ game” sacred to him on
the l5th of February, when his votaries ran about naked, lashing
every person they met with goat-skin thongs, particularly
women, who, it was believed, were, by these blows, rendered more
prolific, and relieved when in travail. The word comes from
lupus, “ a wolf,'’ and arceo, to “ ward off. '’ He was called λύκαιος, in
Greek, from λύκος, lupus. Lyceus, a mountain in Arcadia, was
sacred to him, and called from him. Mythologists say that he
was called from πᾶν, omne, as he was the symbol of the universe.
He was usually painted half man and half goat. The epithet
Inuus was given him, ab ineundo animalia, from a belief that
flocks and herds were rendered fruitful by his influence.

⁷³ Eae eo ywere] Of that race who inhabited Pallanteum.

⁷⁴ Deditis ludicro, dfe] “ That a band of robbers, enraged
against them for having· deprived them of some booty, having
made a sudden attack on them when engaged in this game, as it
was a well known anniversary festival,—’'; they fixed on this as a
proper time for attaek. For notum here several editions incor-
rectly read votum.-— Quum Romulus vi se defendisset, “ as Romu-
lus saved himself by a vigorous defenee.”

⁷⁵ Ultra] This word meanS, contrary to what may be
expected or ought to be done. Hor. Od. 4. 4.-Sectamur ultro
quos opimus effuqere triumphus. The robbers, who themselves
deseryed to be punished, unexpectedly brought the first charge.
So AEn. 5. 55, nunc ultro (unexpeetedly) ad cineres ipsius et ossa
parentis—adsumus.

⁷³ Crimini maxime dabant] “ They made it the principal
charge.''
