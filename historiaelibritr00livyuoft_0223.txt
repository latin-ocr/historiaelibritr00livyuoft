dissertation about them. There were also two aediles of the
people created at this time to serve and assist the tribunes.

⁵ Duos tantzim in sacro monte creatos] And that the remain-
ing three were elected in the city, after the people returned.

⁸ Sacratam leqem] “Devoting law.‘' A lex sacrata meant
in general any law, the violation of which was punished by
devoting the violator, with his family and property, to some god⁴
There were many such laws. It was by virtue of one of them
that the tribunes were sacred and inviolable, saerosancti.-There
is mention made of them several times in Livy.—See B. 3. c.
, 32.-B. 4. c. 26.-B. 7. c. 41. See also B. 2. c. 8. 11.

'¹ Per secessionem] Dionysius says this lasted three months.
They retii-ed about the first of September, and returned about
the first of December.

⁸ Sp. Cassius et Postumius Cominius] Glareanus observes
that we should read here iterum, as these were consuls before.

⁹ Inde Poluscam, item Volscorum, cepit] ‘⁶ After that he took
Polusca, which also belonged to the Volsci.”—See ch. 39.
Several old copies and MSS. read 2⁸1sz protinas Mucamitem (some,
Ulscamitem5 some, Novocamitem) Volscorum cepit.

¹⁰ Caedeque in proxima urbis faeni] Rhenanus, Walker‚ and
Doujatius, say the words mean, that the slaughter of the citizens,
who sallied out, was not only carried to the gates, but even to
the parts of the city which were near the gates. This appears
to me a strange interpretation. In note 32. ch. 14, it is seen
that the accusative after the preposition in, in imitation of the
Greeks, who often used εἷς for ἐν, has sometimes the same
signification as the ablative3 hence some, in a passage higher up,
read in stationem Esar-cius filit. So here, in proxima urbis means
“ in the parts of the city which were next the gate.'' He pursued
them into the city, and there, where it is natural to think they
faceti about to make resistance‚ they were slaughtered. In
proxim& urbeis the reading of some copies and MSS„ i. e. in primii
urbe, primd signifying ‘⁶ the first part of? One MS. has in
proxima parte urbis, which makes all quite plain.

¹¹ Primo ortw] Ad terrorem (ut solet) primum ort12⁸ is con-
sidered the most correct reading. Rhenanus says primo ortu
means statim. ’

¹² Obstitit] “ Eclipsed or weighed down .” This verb properly
means to stand in the way of any thing so effectually as to
impede its progress, and render it nugatory3 hence to countcr-
balance.—See B. l. c. 26. n.-B. 2. c. 2. n.

¹⁸ Ab Sp. Cassio uno, quia colleya abfuerat, ictum] Quia
here explains uno. Cominius at this time was among the
Volscians. The inscription on the column, it appears, contained
only the name of Cassius. Were it not that the absence of the
other consul on a military enterprise (except on s-uch an occasion,
the consul was never out of Rome in those times) was notified
