NOTEs To BooK 111. c. 24, 25. 319

met-hod of proceeding was this: the plaintiff either named the
judge (which was termed ferre judicem) who was to try the cause3
or he left the nomination to the defendant, which was styled
ut judicem diceret ; and when they had agreed on a judge, quum
,iudex convenisset, they presented a joint petition to the praetor,
that he would appoint that person, ut judicem daret, to try the
cause: and at the same time they bound themselves to pay a
certain sum of money,-—the plaintiff, if he should not establish
his charge, ni ita esset ; the defendant, if the plaintiff should
succeed in establishing his charge, si ita esset.

'¹¹ Teste Volscio] “ Thau that of Kaeso had been on the
evidence of Volscius.’'

¹² In comitiorum disceptationem] “ To a striving· about the
election.''

¹³ Infesta] ’‘Harassed by dissensions.”-—See c. 68. Π.-Β.
2. ο. 11. n. 98. Hence the word ‘⁶ infest.’' Infestus is not often
used in this sense.

CHAP. XXV.-¹⁴ Duas residuas] κ Found on their hands
the two causes that remained undeeided from the last year,’'
i. e. the law of Volero and the trial of Volscius. Excipio often
meam, as here, “to receive a thing from one’s predecessor, to
succeed to a thing ;'’ sometimes it is neuter, and means “to
follow.”—See B. 2. c. 61.

¹⁵ Valerii filia] These words should be M, or Μαηὶἰ filio,
for he is thus designated in the fasti Capitolini. The designa-
tion of a person was taken from the father’s praenomen, not from
his family name. Sometimes it was taken from the father's coq-
mmaen, if it was by that he was best known. This M. Valerius
was consul two years after this, and his father, M. Valerius, was
dictator in the year 260.

¹⁶ Maximum] “ That greatest of the young Romans.'' i. e.

is often understood in similar phrases .—-So B. 2. c. 44, unum vel
adversas omnes satis essa—B. 35. c. 34. and 37, Quinctius
layatique.

¹⁹ Edocuissent] This is the pledge that Valerius the consul
had given.-See c. 18.

of most MSS„ which is incorrect.
