sive, but the furniture, and vessels, and tools for working,
necessary in the camp, all of which they had lost.

OnAP. XLH1.-⁹³ L. Siccium iu Sabinis] “They send L.
Siccius quartered among the Sabines, to make observations for
the purpose of choosing a situation for a camp3 who, availing
himself of the odium against the decemvirs‚ was making mention,
in his secret conversations to the common soldiers, of secession
and the election of tribunes.’' In Sabinis, i. e. he was in the
army that acted against the Sabines. Dionysius, Β. 10, sayS, that
h'e was engaged in one hundred and twenty battles ; had received
forty-five wounds, all in front3 had obtained four civic crowns,
three mural crowns, eighty-three necklaces, sixty bracelets,
eighteen spears, and twenty-five trappings‚ as rewards of his
valour.—See c. 58. n. 49.

⁹⁴ Pari viribus anima] “Possessing courage equal to his
strength.”

⁹⁵ Praecipitatum in insidias essa] Scil. ab iis, ‘⁶ that they had
fallen into an ambush.²’ As praecipitare is often used in Livy
(see B. 2. c. 51.-B. 5. c. 18,) in an absolute or neuter signifi-
cation, praecipitatum esse here is taken impersonally.

⁹⁶ Placebat, ni decemviri] “ And it was resolved that Siccius
should be carried immediately to Rome, (which would have been
put into execution) had not the decemvirs, &c.” The reader
will see several instances of such an ellipsis where ni occurs.
The verb in the clause antecedent to ni, should be repeated and
put in the same mood and tense with the verb that depends on
ni. In Livy the imperfect indic. is osten used before ni in the
same sense as if it had been the pluper. subjunctive.

CHAP. XLIV-⁹⁷ Honestum ordinem] “Led a first rank.''
In each manipulus there were two centurions distinguished by
the titles prior and posterior, because one was chosen and ranked
before the other. These centurions, called ordinum ductores,
were chosen from the common soldiers, according to their merit,
by the tribunes of the soldiers, sometimes by the consul or pro-
consul. The centurion of the first century of the first manipulus
of the triarii or pilarii, was called primipilus ; see B. 2. c. 27. n.
323 the centurion of the second century of the first manipulus
of the triarii, was called primipilus posterior. The centurions
‚of the second manipulus of the triarii, were called prior centurio
et posterior centurio secundi pili ; and so on to the tenth, who
were called prior centurio and posterior centurio decimi pili. In
like manner the centurions of the two other lines, which were
called principes and hastati, were styled primus princepS, secundus
princeps, διας primus hastatus, secundus hastatus, διο. Any of
the chief centurions was said, honestum ordinem ducere.-See B.
