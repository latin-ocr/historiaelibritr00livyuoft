No'rns ‘ro Boon 11. c. 39, 40. 211

’⁸ Stationes] These were a kind of out-poste, or guards,
placed before the gates.-See B. 4. c. 40. Viyiliae were held
within the camp at night. Eoeczcbiae were watches either by day
or night. Custodiae or proesz‘dia, guards on the ramparts.—See
B. 3. 0. 5.

'¹⁹ Traditum est ; nihilo maffia] Gronovius would read tra-
ditum (scil. traditum est ,·) et nihilo maqw, ᾇσ. This would make
the sentence somewhat more simple, though there are many
instances of the present reading.

emp. XL.—⁸⁰ Id publicum consilium] Dionysius, B. 8, says
that this measure was recom mended by Valeria, the sister of Publi-
cola. Plutarch says that his wife’s name was Virgilia. An is
understood to id. So also farther down at ad hostem, an adfilium.

⁸¹ In primm] ‘⁶ In the beginning ;” so, ὰ primo means “from
the beginning.’'-—Cic. Att. 8. ll. Some old copies read primo'.

⁸⁹ Prope ut amens, consternatus] “ Confounded‚ almost like
one who had lost his reason.”

⁸³ Sine ...... scisma] ‘³ Let me know ;” ἰ. e. sine me ut sciam.

⁸⁴ Non ..... succurrit] ‘⁶ Did not this thought occur to you ‘3⁹’

⁸⁵ Sed eqo nihil jam pati, nec tibi turpius, queim mihi miserius,
possum] “But Ι 0311 now suffer nothing, that will not bring
more disgrace on you, than misery on me3 nor, though I am now
most miserable, am Ι likely to be long so.’' She alludes, in con-
sequence of her old age, to the speedy prospect of death. De
his videris, “look to these ;’' i. e. your wife and children. Nec
tihi turpius, nec mihi miserius is another reading of the passage.

⁸⁶ Invidia rei oppressum] “ That he was murdered by the
Volscians on account of the odium exeited against him by
this act.

⁸⁷ Alii alio leta] ‘⁶ Different authors say that he died by a
different kind of death-’³ Cicero (in Bruto, 0. 10,) says, that,
like his cotemporary Themistocles, he died by his own hand.

⁸⁸ Fabium] See B. l. c. 44.

⁸⁹ Monumento quoque] i. e. The men were not only lavish of
their praises of the women, but even dedicated a temple to
female fortune, as a lasting monument of their meritorious
conduct. Gronovius proposes que for quoque, which certainly is
a more natural expression here; unleSS, according to some com-
mentators, we believe that some words have fallen out of the
text, which are to be found in Cujatius, B. 12. 0. 24, purporting
that the women were thenceforward to wear purple robes and
golden necklaces, and that the men were to leave the way for
them if they met them. This is asserted by Valer. Max. B. 5.
c. 2. But it is not mentioned by Dionysius or Plutarch. This
temple, says Valer. Max„ (B. l. c. 8.-B. 5. c. 2,) was built on
the spot where the women had the successful interview with

Coriolanus3 no one but a woman, who was only once married,
could touch the statue.
