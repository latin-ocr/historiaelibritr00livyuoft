NOTES To BOOK 1. c. 17, 18. 77

'⁰ Gratiam ineunt, dra] “ They gain favour with the people
by rendering up the sovereign power3 but in such a way as to
retain as much as they surrendered.'’

¹¹ Auctores fierent] “If they give it the sanction of their
authority?

¹² Idem jus] The same form of law is retained3 but it lost
its power, as, by the Publian and Maenian laws, the patricians
were bound to ratify every decree ef the people.—See B. 8. c.
12.

. ¹³ In incertum comitiorum eventum patres auctores fiunt]
i.e. Even when the decision of an election is uncertain, the
patricians beforehand gave the sanction of their authority to
whatever measure may be afterwards carried.

¹⁴ Quod bonum, faustum, felixque sit] “A thing which I
pray may be advantageous, auspicious, and fortunate.’' This is
a usual form used in prayer before entering on any business.—
See Brisson, Β. 1,

cflff. XV111.—¹⁵ Centum amplias post annos] “ More than
a hundred years after.’'

¹⁶ AEmulantium studim] Adopting his principles or tenets.
So Cicero pro Murena, c. 29, “Zeno, cujus inventorum aemuli
Stoici nominantur.'’—Tacit. Hist. B. 3. c. 81, Studia philoso-
phiae et placita studiorum aemulatm.

¹⁷ Ex quibus locis, quoe fama in Sabinos, aut quo linquae com-
mercio—quenquam excivisset? <S·c.] “ From which distant places
what repert of his great talents extending as far as the
Sabines‚ or by means of what intercourse of language, even
though he did live in the same age, could have excited any one
to a desire of learning? er under what protection could an in-
ffividual, &c.’' This is rather unusual, and no simple Latin.
The distance between the places was so considerable, and the
intercourse between them so little, on account of the difference
of language in these barbarous times, (for in these cities Greek
was the language,) that it was not likely that the reputation of
Pythagoras could have reached the Sabines, or that any Sabine
would have gone to him3 aut I think shows that different reasons
are implied in quibus locis, and commercio linyuae. Qud fanni is
the reading of several old and respectable copies, in which case
Pythaqoras must be the subject to excivisset.—Grovonius, as
quoted by Drakenborch, would read qud famd tum Sabinos, δῖα.
Others would transpose in Sabinos, and read the passage thus:
Ψιᾶ fama, aut quo. . . .eaecivz·sset ; quove praesidz‘o. . . . in Sabinos
pervenisset?

¹⁸ Inqenio] His own innate qualities.

¹⁹ Ad laevam ejus, capite velata] “ The augur, with his head
covered, took his station on the king’s left.'’ The augur faced
the east, and the king the south.-P1uta1·ch says the augur stood
behind him, αὐτόςδέ ποιμα-τὰς {amaeam The words, siqnum con-
tra, qud lonqissim& oculi serebant, show that the augur’s eyes were
