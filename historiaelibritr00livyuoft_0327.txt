the “ intention’' of the patricians. They wished to all appearance
that the question should be only put off t'or a time, but in reality
they wished that it should be altogether withdrawn. 1 think
rather that Livy speaks about a real fact, as B. 2. c. 61. n. 12.
The tribunes induced Terentillus to allow the consideration ot'
the question to be deferred until the consuls arrived; it was ac-
cordingly, to all appearances at- that time, only deferred, not
abandoned altogether, although it afterwards turned out to be
wholly abandoned for that year.

CHAP. X.—6⁴ Auqet] “ He adds to his glory on his arrival,
byexposing, ἄπο. &c.”

⁶⁵ Id antiquina] The consul thought the affair of his triumph
of greater importance, and that it should be determined first.
The tribune, on the other hand, thought that it ought to be deferred
until the law had been passed 3 so that the question between the
two, whether the law or the triumph should be decided first, was
in agitation for some days, until the tribune at last allowed the
consul to carry his point.—-See B. 1. ο. 32. n. 81. for the mean-

tribune and consul, that the consul was in the city3 whereas,
generally the consul was obliged to wait outside the city, until
the triumph was decreed him.

θ’ Omma] An ovation was an honour inferior to the triumph.
In the ovation, the general entered the city, not in a chariot, but
on foot3 dressed, not in the trabea, but in the proeteoeta only3
crowned with myrtle, in place os laure13 and attended by a band
of flute-players ; a sheep, ovis, (hence the name) and not a bull,
was sacrificed on the occasion.

⁶⁷ Bovem locutam] The ox had spoken the year before, a fact
which was not then believed3 but the appearance of other prodi-
gies this year gained it credit.

⁶⁸ Gar-nem pluit] Pluere is often found with an ablativa—-
So B. 1. c. 31, lapidibus pluisse.

Β Mutant] This verb, like verto and many others, is osten
neuter.

'⁰ Librat] It is said that when Tarquinius Superbus was
building the capitol, an old woman came and offered him nine
books for a certain sum, which he refused to give3 on this she
retired, and, having burned three, returned, and demanded the
same sum for the remaining six, which he again refused to give.
She retired a second time, and, having burned three more, still
demanded the same sum for the remaining three. Tarquin,
struck by the singularity of the circumstance, consulted the
aug-urs, who recommended him to purchase them at any price.
These books, which were supposed to contain prophetie informa-
tion about the fate and fortune of the Roman state, were eare-
fully deposited in a stone chest, in a vault under the eapit013
and two officers were chosen from the order of the patrician
