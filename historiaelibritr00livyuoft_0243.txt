synonymous with spoliari in this passage, except that in circum-
scindere more violence is implied.

⁵¹ Advocatis] “And those, whom he called on to help him,

⁵⁸ In senatum vocari] “When he ordered the fathers to be

’ summoned into the senate.'’ This form of words, in this sense,
is often found in Livy3 so vocare ad concilium, advocare ad con-

CHAP. LV1.—⁵⁹ Tribunum plebi] Plebi is sometimes put for
plebei, the genitive of plebes ; or it may be the dative from pleb&
as the dative is often put for the genitive. Some read plebis ,-
and so-me omit the word.

⁶⁰ Contraque omnium] For a similar use of que, see B. 3.
ch. 38. n.

⁶³ Permismrum tribunatum] “ Would give loose rein to his
tribuneship.” Permitto is used to signify giving loose rein to a
horse, and inciting him.—See B. 3. c. 61.

‘² Post publicam causam] “Postponing private resentment

>⁸⁸ Plebei mayn-tratas tributis comitiis] Dionysius says that these
were first created at the comitia curiata. At the comitia tribu-ta,

tribes (see B. 1. c. 43. n. 11.) individually3 here each man²s vote
was equally effectua13 so that the patricians, even if they attended

without the authority of the patriciam, and for the purpose of
creating the inferior magistrates, such as tribunes of the people‚
aediles, quaestors, δια, also proconsuls, propraetors, &c.; electing
certain priests, and holding trials. Their deerees were called
plebiscita, which, after the year 306, (see B. 3. c. 55,) bound the
whole Roman people. Before that they bound only the plebeians.

⁶⁴ Haud parva res sub titulo minime atroci] “ Under a title,
at first appearance not at all formidable, was this measure pro—
posed—no trifling one, but one which took away, &c.'' The resi-
dent plebeian citizens were the only persons who voted at the
comitia curiata ,· these were less hostile to the patricians, and fewer
than the non-residents, who were ranked among the tribes (and
voted at the comitia tributa) and not among the curiae, as the resi-
dents were3 hence the patricians were less influential in the
comitia tributa than at the comitia curiata. At the comitia
curiata, the people voted by curiae, 01⁰ which a majority, sixteen,
<there were only thirty) decided every question. Here also pro-
