among the patricians, but not even among the consuls them-
selves—Qec B. 1. c. 40. n. 61.

(ΖΗ-η». ΧΧΙῩ.-13 Nomina darent] i. e. To be registered
as soldiers.

¹⁴ Maaeimd illd, sed tamen parta] “ That fear for the safety
of the commonwealth interrupted their deliberation concerning
that portion (i. e. the plebeians) of the state, which, though in-
deed the greatest portion, was yet but a portion.'' He says that
they constituted but a part, and not the whole, of the state, as
they themselves, by their violence, would seem to believe they did.

¹⁵ Bello praevertisse quicquam] ‘⁴ That no consideration could
take precedence of that war: and even though there was some
respite fr0m the enemy's attack, that it would be dishonourable
for the plebeians not to have taken up arms for their country,
until they first received hire, and that it would reflect on the
dignity of the patricians to have relieved the fallen for-tunes of
the plebeians through fear, rather than afterwards through incli-

and of course considered as part of his property.

After the levy was completed, one soldier was chosen to repeat
over the words of the military oath, (qui reliquis verba sacra-
menti praeiret,) and the rest swore after him (in verba ejus
jurabant ). Every one, as he passed along, said idem in me.
Sacramentum dicere is another way of expressing it. Sacra-
mento appears to be an ablative‚ governed by ez· or some such
preposition understood.

Cast. XXV-12 Transitio] “ Desertion.’' Proditio, “ thx
abandoning of one’s post.”

²⁰ Vellebantur] “ The fortifications were being demolished;”
i· e. they began to pull up the stakes of which chiefly they were
built.

²¹ Circumdatis] “ Being drawn round it.''

ἦ Recreatus] “ By this the needy soldiers were relieved a little.”

Can. XXV1.-²³³ Confestim] “Immediately after, the Sa-
bines also ;’' ἰ. e. as well as the Volscians.
