Some copies omit pacem.

’Β Volens propitius] “ Willingly and propitiously 3⁹⁹ 3 form
of words usual in prayer.

⁹² Fuisse credo tum quoque aliquos] “ Then too;” i. e. as
well as afterwards, when it. was the generally received opinion
among the rational. Dionysius, Valerius, Maximus, Plutarch,
and others, state the fact3 to this Tarquinius Superbus alludes‚
c. 49, when he says that Romulus was never buried.

⁹⁸ Pavor praesens] The awe they felt at, the time naturally
led them to a superstitious belief that he was carried to heaven.

⁹⁹ Gravis quamvis maqnae rei auctor, δῖα] “Weighty autho-
rity for any fact, howev er important it might be.''

¹ Contra intueri sas esset. ] ‘⁶ Tha‘c it may be allowed without
sustaining any injury to look himin the face. ' The ancients had
a belief that it was not safe for a mortal to look at a divinity.

N. B. In page 17, of text, line 9, for Romani read Romanis.

'Alit-um, quantum . .ficlei fuerit. ] Most editions read
fides. Thoug h mirum quan stim, immane qnantzim, and such ex-
press ions, are highly class ical, when used by wax· of parenthesis;
as in Greek, ἒαυμασντέν ι’σον, ἀμνχανον ἴσον. 3· et W &lker thinks they
are joined always to an indicative3 as, id mirum quantum profuit
ad concordiam, Β. 2.-70. 1 ; and that we must either read mirum
quantum illi fiTIes fuit, 01· adopt the present reading. Some
would read quantafidw. Duker says quantzimfides may be jus-
tified by taking qnantum to be the same as in quantum; so we
find parum fidem, satis otium, satis tempus habere.

CHAP. XV11.-³ Necdum ad sinqulos . . . pervenerat] Under-
stand certamen requi ac cupido ,· the original reading was ἆ sin-
qulis . . . pervenerant factiones.

⁴ In societate φρικὶ] T hough both enjoyed an even share in
the rights and privileges of government.

⁵ Reqnari tamen omnes volebant] So Plutarch, in his life of
Numa, says, οὗ μὴν ἀλλὰ βασιλεύεσθαι μὲν ἒδᾶκει mim. Reqem and
reynare are other readings.

⁰ Centum patrea] Dionysius says the senate at this time
consisted of two hundred, as one hundred had been added by
Tatius to the old senate of one hundred.

'¹ Decuriis] “ Decury,’' was a name often given to a number
greater than ten.

⁸ Imperium] The opinion of Dionysius, who says imperium
here means each senator’s power, seems entitled to greater credit
than that of Plutarch, who says it means each Deeury’s power 3
for, whenever an interrex was at any after period appointed, (as
was often the case when there was no chief magistrate,) liis
power lasted five days, and no longer.

’Aee ultra, nisi reqem. ‚videbantur passuri. “They did
not seem likely any longer to submit to 311ζ,1 one but. a king, and
that king appointed by themselves?
