'¹' Eludentes] This word properly means to parry off or get
rid of a blow in a gladiator's fight, which was called ludus.

’Β Proesentia instabant, αι] “ Were pressing 011 1110111 at that

“ Because they could not be neglected at any time (i. e. it would
be unsafe not to mind them,) and they did not allow the Romans
to turn off their attention to any other matter.” Though perhaps
this way of writing is not unusual in English, yet I apprehend it
to be so in Latin. Mark the peculiarity of averti here3 it is the
same as avertere se ,· this is expressed by the middle voice 111
Greek. We often meet this idiom in Latin.

CHAP. XLIX-⁸⁵ Deposcant, 11ωο Volscos] Scil. haec depos·
cat Volscos, illa deposcat AEquos.

⁸⁸ Paludatus] “Dressed in his military costume.”-—See B. 1.
c. 26. n. 92.

⁸⁷ Eqreqius senatus] “ Not one of whom would an honest
senate at any time deem unworthy to be the leader of an army.”
Tanaquil, Faber, Dujatius‚ and Crevier, think that for senatus
we should read exercitus. See Dionysius, B. 9. p. 581. Perizon.
Animadver. Histor. c. 5. p. 194. Walker successfully main-
tains against Perizonius, that this number of the Fabian elan
is correct. The Fabii were an original Roman family 3 here their
connexion by blood 31111 marriage in the remotest degree are in-
cluded3 they were not cut down by Tarquin, who only attacked
the wealthiest3 so it is not too much to say that the Fabii
amounted to 306. Festus says that a body of 5000 clansmen or
dependants accompanied them.

’Β Propria] “ One part belonging to themselves, composed
of their relations and acquaintances.'' Propria is opposed to
publica, which latter means those 11110 11311 110 private tie with the

expressions as he before applied the word ducem ,· for virtus et
filicitas were words applied to the commanders of armies; to allies,
subordinate officers, and soldiers virtus et fides were the words
emplo ed.

⁹⁰ Iifilici vici dea-tro Jano porta> Carmentalis] This word Janus
sometimes means an arch or arcade. Cic. de Nat. Deor. L. 2.
27, transitiones perviae Jani nominantur. There was 3 celebrated
one of these near the forum, where money-brokers assembled.
Hence, Horace, Sat. 2. 3. 18, postquam omnis res mea Janam ad
mediumfracta est. Et. ep. 1. 54, hoc Janus summus ab imo pro-
docet. Janus summas, medias, imus, mean “the highest, middle,
and lowest parts of it.” The gate Carmentalis had 1110 01· three
of these archways 3 the Fabii went through the right. Ovid, Fast.
B. 2. v. 201.

Carmentis portae dextro est via proxima Jano,
Ire per hanc noli, quisquis es, omen habet.
