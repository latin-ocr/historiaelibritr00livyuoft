NOTES To· Boon 11. c. 30, 31. 201

⁸⁷ Medio campa] “In the interjacent plain between the
camps.” So media planities, Sall. Jug. flsedius signifies some-
times “ lying· between ;'' sometimes, “ in the middle of.'’

⁶⁸ Coortos] He very correctly uses this word, as he besora
described them to have stood with their pikes fixed in the ground.
The word consuryere he also applies to the charge of the triarii,
who waited the enemy with the left leg extended.—See B.
8. c. 8.

⁸⁹ Velut stupentibus-‚J ‘⁶ who appeared to them as if they were
paralyzed by fear.”

⁷⁰ Impressionem] “ A charge.'’

'¹¹ Adepti fessos} “ Having easily overtaken the exhausted
fugitives, they both took the camp by assault, and, &cf

⁷² Plus sanquiniS.....factum.] “ More blood was shed.’' The
phrase facere sanquinem, to shed blood, occurs also in B. 9. c.
l3.-B. 35. c. 51.—And in Ovid, ep. 14. Her. v- 82.

CHAP. ΧΧΧΙ.--73 Fundit] “Breaks their lines,'’fv9atque,
‘⁴ and puts them to flight.”

⁷¹ Qua, dum se cornua latias pandunt] “ In the part where,
while the wings extended too widely, they had not properly
strengthened with companies their line of battle in the centre.”
Some read quam, and reJect the second aciem, from a dislike of
the repetition of the same word. But Livy shows numerous
instances of similar repetitions.

⁷⁵ Debellatumque est] “And the war was ended.’'-See c.
263 i. e. the war was concluded by the subjugation of the enemy,-
for the word means not to put an end to the war in any way,
such as, by peace.

'⁶ Colonia deducta] In leading out a new colony a great deal
of form was observed. A decree of the senate or people should
be first passed, and the auspices, when consulted, shou'ld be
favourable. The names of the colonists were regularly enrolled,
and certain commissionem, generally three, called triumviri
coloniae deducendae, sometimes more, were appointed to lead it
out3 and i tmarched on under flying colours. When arrived at
the place of destination, the founder, dressed in the Gabinian
cinctum, marked with a plough the boundary of their city and
territory. A new colony could not be led out to a. place, where
a colony had formerly been planted, according to the regular
ceremonie83 but, if the original colony was falling off, it was
usual to reinforce it by enrolling new colonists3 this was called
adem-ibere colonos. Some colonies consisted of Roman citizens
only3 some, of Latins, and other natives of Italy. Most writers
are of opinion that the Roman colonists had not the right of vot-
ing or bearing offiees at Rome. The Latin and other Italian
colonists were in a worse condition. The oolonioe differed from
the municipia in this, that they used the laws prescribed to
them by the Romam, but had almost the same kind of magis*
