Norns 'ro Boon 11. c. 41, 42. 213

⁸ Propizzs fidem] “More credible.” Fidem, say the com-
mentators, is governed by ad, understood. So, ch. 40, proxime
firmam latrocinii. Propiics and proxime are often thus joined to
an accusative.

⁴ K.] Koesone for Caesone. K. is the ancient abbreviation
for this praenomen. This is the first mention of quaestors we find
'xi Livy. Tacitus (Annal. B. 11. c. 22,) says that there were
quaestors under the kings, and that they were continued by
Brutus and the following consuls.

⁵ Diem dictam perduellionis] “ T hat a day of trial for treasoze
was appointed him.’' So Val. Max. Β. 6. c. 5., diem lzz's P.
Rutilius tribunus plebis perduellionis ad populum dizit-Diem
dicere is often used to mean “to appoint a day of trial.”—See
B. 1. c. 26. n. 96. 2.

ΟΗΑΡ. XL11.-⁶ IlIaliqnitate] “Parsimony.” This is the
sense in which this word is generally used in Livy.--See B. 3.
c. 63.-B. 5. c. 20. 22.-Β. 2. c. 3.

'¹ Redeqit in publicum] Lodged the price of it in the public

by this law—See B. 3. c. 31. n.

¹¹ Gratuiti.] Voluntary or gratuitous⁴

¹² Fabium] He was also the brother of Q. Fabius, who was
consul three years before this.

¹³ Expertes tribuniciis certaminibus] Expertes here appears
co mean not so much that during his consulships he was well
practised or versed in the disputes with the tribunes—that his
successive offices were one series of struggles with the tribunes,
and of experience in these struggles—-as that his “fidelity”
to the cause of the patricians was “ tried'’ and established—See
B. l. c. 34, end.

¹⁴ Prope supererant vires.] “They had almost a super-
abundance of strength.’'—See c. 27.

¹⁵ Accessere ad oeqras jam omnium mentes prodiqia coelestia]

¹⁶ Vates canebant . . . nunc extis, nunc per aves, consulti] The
commentators are diffuse in talking of the intricacy of this
passage, without giving any rational solution of it. In Walker's
edition, and others, these words are thus explained, consulte·
