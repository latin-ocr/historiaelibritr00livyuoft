the verb inhibere in this sense.—See ch. 50, 59.-B. 4. e. 56, 53.

⁴⁴ Imperiumque...indi9nabantur.] “And they (i. e. the
neighbouring states) thought 11 a shame that sovereign power,
&c.” Though que 11010 couples the verbs ccepti erant and indiq-
nubantur, yet there is a peculiarity in the structure of the
sentence, of which there are other instances; the two verbs
have different subjectS.——See B. 2. 011. 49. n.—c· 56. n. 60. and
0. 58. 11. 87.-Β. 4. 0. 17; and Virg. AEn. 6. 2833 quam sedem

⁵⁰ A caetu.] Amovere se ὰ coeiu, is applied to one who goes
off to a distance from a society or meeting, whether 110 was
or was not before connected with it; but amovere se ὲ coetu, is
applied to one who quits an assembly, of which he was once
a member3 as, amovere se ὲ medio, is “to retire from a society
in which a person has once mox-ed? abstrahere navim ὲ portu,
“to bring a ship 0111 of the port in which she lay ;’' therefore, as
the senators did not entirely relinquish their rank or office, ἒ
coetu, which is 1110 reading of Gronovius and others, is incorrect.
