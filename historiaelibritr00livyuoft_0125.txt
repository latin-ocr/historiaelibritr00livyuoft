Norns To BOOK 1. c. 48, 49. 107

Onu. XLVIII.—⁵⁷ Multo quam servum potiorem, filium reqis,
requi haeredem] “ Who, as being a king’s son, would be a much
fitter heir for the kingdom than a slave.''

⁵⁸ Per licentiam] “ By permission, with impunity ;’' or “ by
arbitrary insolence.” Elzcdentem. This properly means “to
parry off a blow’' from an antagonist in a gladiator’s sight-See
B. 2. c. 36. n.

⁵⁰ Ad coqendum senat-ami] It appears that the senators fied in
the tumult.

⁶⁰ Semianimz' reyio comitam] Livy mentioned their flight in
the preceding sentence 3 probably, therefore, we should read se
minime reqio comitatu, says Walker; this reading of the pas-
sage, which most commentators say is corrupt, offers less vio-
lence to the text than any other which has been proposed, and
furnishes the same meaning as most of them. Many reject the
words as an interpolation of some transcriber. In many MSS.
and copies semianimis reqio comitatu is used.

⁶¹ Cyprium vicum] “ The top of street CypriUS.'’ This was
inhabited by Sabines. Cyprius, in the Sabine dialect, is the
same as bonus, according to Varro.

θ’ IVon abhorret ἁ caetero scelere] “ It is not inconsistent with
the rest of her atrocious conduct.'' Abhorrere is sometimes
joined to a dative 3 so we say in English, “ abhorrent from,'’ or
“ abhorrent to,” a thing, in the same sense.

ὦ Nec reverita] “ Not abashed at such a multitude of men.’'

Β* Reqemque prima appellavit] “ Was the first to salute him
by the name of king.3’

⁰⁵ Dianium] A place consecrated tn Diana. So Vulcanium,
Minervium.

⁶⁶ Flectenti] (Scil. Tulliae.) This may depend on restitit or
ostendit. Flectente, taken absolutely, is the common reading.
Gronovius would read flectens or flectendo, and refers it to auriqa.
—Most MSS. read flectere carpentum in deoetram jussit auriqam,
ut in clivum, (5⁶0.

θ’ Orbium] This was so called on account of its circular
windings (orbes). Virbium is the common reading, which is
quite incorrect, as the hill Virbius is between Bovillae and
Aricia3 and Bovillae was eleven miles from Rome on the
Appian road.

⁶⁸ Foedum.] “The shocking and inhuman wickedness of her
conduct is handed down to us ever since3 and the place serves
as a monument to record it.''

⁰⁹ Quibus iratis ...... exitus sequerentur] “ Through whose
