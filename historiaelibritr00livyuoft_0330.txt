CHAP. ΧΠΙ.--ι Οταεεαπίαπ.] “ Rioting in the Suburra.'’
This was the part of the city, from which the first city tribe was
called Subur-rana.

⁸ Capitalis rei dies dicta] A day appointed for the trial of a
oepital charge.—-See c. 11. n. 88.

⁴ Medio decreto expediunt] The force of expediunt is this:
the tribunes were in a sort of dilemma between Kaeso and the
tribune Virginius3 they wished to support the tribune, but had a
right to receive the appeal of Kaeso ; therefore they extricated
themselves by passing a decree‚ which adopted a middle course,
i. e. which conceded something to both.

placed at the bar, as we say.

⁶ In publica] “ In public custody.''

money which they paid for Kaeso.

¹⁴ Id maxime] These words can admit of two significations3
they mean either “particularly that portion of the young nobility

what was above all others consistent with the conduct of Kaeso’s
companions.”

¹⁵ Sed ibi . . . qued] “ But there they gained a very great ad-
vantage‚ in that they in some measure moderated their violence?
Drakenborch says ibi is used for tum. But Walker says it
is the same as in eo, as in Ter. Adel. 5. 4. 13, uxorem duxi.-
quam ibi miseriam. vidi? So alibi often means in aliis rebus.
