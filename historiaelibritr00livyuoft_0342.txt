324 morus 'ro 3001 111. c. 33, 34.

Can. XXX111.-⁹² Trecentesimo altera] “ In the three
hundred and first year after Rome had been built? It was the
three hundred and third year, or the end of the three hundred
and second year, according to Dodwell.

⁹⁸ Luxuriavere] “ Degenerated into licentious extravagance.’'

’⁴ Repetitumque] “ And the practice was revived.”

⁹⁵ Graves quoque aetate] “ They say that there were also
elected by the last voteS‚ (i. e. to fill up the last places,) men ad-
vanced in years, that they might be less violent in their opposition
to the decisions of the others.” In the preceding sentences,
Livy gave reasons for the election of six of the decemvir33 in
this, he says, four others “ also” were elected for the reason which
he mentions.

⁹⁸ Aurae popularis captator] “ That all at once he became a
courter of the plebeians, and one that caught at every breath of
popular favour ;” a metaphor borrowed from one at sea in a calm,
catching at every favourable breath of wind to swell his sail.
The metaphoris used extensively, as aura libertatis, ch. 373 aura
spei, B. 42. ch. 39, διο. Aura, by itself, has sometimes the same
meaning3 see B. 6. ch. 11.

⁹⁷ Decimo dien] ‘¹ They administered justice individually every
tenth day ;’' ἰ. e. each of them one day in ten, according aa it
came to his turn.

⁸⁸ Penes praefectum juris] “ Attended him who in his turn
presided over the administration of justice.”

⁹⁸ Colleqis novem] “Single beadles attended his nine col-
leagues;’' i. e. each was attended by one. These beadles, or
bailiffs, were called apparitores, acc-emi, lictores, viatores, ante-
ambulones.

¹ Et in unica concordia] “ And notwithstanding the singular
unanimity that existe-d among themselves, (a harmony that some-
times proves injurious to private individuals,) they behaved with
the greatest equity to all others.’' Livy shows that, in the next
year, this unanimity among their successors was prejudicial to
the people. Inutilis, and such expressions that signify the ab·
sence of good, ane often used by the Latin authors, and not un-
frequently English too, in imitation of the Greeks, to express
positive evil.—See B. 5. c. 6.

² Defosso cadavere] “A dead body being found buried in
the house of P. Sestius.'' This was not the decemvir. Sextium
is the more general reading3 but it appears that, at this time, this
was a plebeian name3 so that we must read Sestium.

³ Cujus rei] This may be translated either “ appeared before
the people as the prosecutor of an act of which he was the law-
ful judge;” or “the prosecutor of a criminal, of whom he was
the lawful judge 3⁹⁹ so that rei may be the genitive of res or reus.
