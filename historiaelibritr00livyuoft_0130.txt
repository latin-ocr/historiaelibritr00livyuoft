²¹³ Termini] This was the god of boundaries3 he was repre-
sented by a stone placed erect, large stones being in early times
the chief boundaries and landmarks3 he was worshipped, ac-
cording to Numa’s institution, with the first fruits. Livy, Epi· -
tome, and B. 5. c. 54, and DionysiuS, B. 3. p. 202, mention, that
the shrine of Juventus (or god of youth) also was not molested.

¹⁹ Caput rerum] Hence the place was called capitol. Others
imagine that the word “ capitol '‘ eomes from Caput Toli ,· and
that Tolus was the man’s name, whose head was dug up there.

⁸⁰ Destinatae erant] See ch. 38, at the end, and ch. 53,
at the beginning.

³¹ Crediderim] See ch. 46. n. 36. Gronovius says, that
400,0001bs. of silver are about 666 talents and 40 minae.
Walker, 1 think, judiciously observes, that as Livy thought such
a sum so incredibly enormous, quadrinqenta talenta here and ch.
53, which some give, is an improbable reading.

Ω Pisoni] L. Calpurnius Piso Frugi, the historian, flourished
in the time of the third Punic war.

be more than sufficient for laying the foundation of any

labour, which was not triffing in itself, was added to the hard-
s‘nips of military service.”

³⁶ Ἐάν-οε] Benches to sit on. Livy, c. 35 and 38, says, that
Tarquinius Priscus erected these seats and built these sewers.

p. 246, that these works were not finished until the time of
Tarquinius Superbus.

³⁷ Nova hoec maqmficeutia] “ These magnificent buildings of
modern times.” See n. 33.

CHAP. Lim-³⁹ Elapsus] Let the young reader observe,
that most verbs compounded with e or ει· are sometimes found
with an ablative with a preposition, as here 3 sometimes with an
ablative without a preposition; sometimes with an accusative
with a preposition; sometimes with an accusative without a
preposition, See B. 2. c. 37. n.

⁴⁰ sortium] These were billets somewhat like dice, on which
the answers of the gods were often written3 they,were thrown
into an urn, and then drawn out, or sometimes cast like dice,v
and their import was explained by the priest. Hence the
