82 morus ‘ro BOOK 1. c. 24, 25.

¹⁹ Quiritium] Is put in apposition with pop. Romani.

⁷⁰ Vasa] “ Do you, my implements and attendants ?'' τ’. e. ἑο
⁷ you include them in my sacred commission and privileges ’ἓ
⁷¹ Quod sinefraude med‘fiat, facim] “ I do appoint you, and
may it be without injury to me and the Roman people, the
Quirites.” Fraus is a loss sustained by treachery, 01· even in
any other way.
⁷² Multisque id verbis] “ And this (the truce) he executea
in a great many words, which being expressed in a long set form,
(carmine) it is not worth while to repeat.”
⁷³ Ut illa palam] “ As those conditionS, both first and last,
· have been publicly recited out of those tables or that wax, (i. e
whether bare table or covered with wax,) without any wicked
treachery, and as they have been understood, dcc.

⁷⁴ Deserit] For defecerit.

⁷⁵ Tu illo die Jupiter] The reading in most MSS. was, tum
ille dies Jupiter. Whence Sigonius and others would read tum
ille diespiter, scil. diei pater.

⁷⁶ Hunc porcum] This is masc. and femin.; it means here
a sow, which was the animal offered in such sacrifices 3 hane,
another reading, is a better word.

⁷⁷ Saxo silice] “ A large flint stone.’' Saxo, it is said, ex-
presses the size, and silice the hard quality of the stone.

CnAP XXV—‘⁸ Et suopte inyem‘o] “ Both courageous from
their own natural disposition, and animated by the shouts, &c.”

⁷⁹ Imperium aqebatur] “Sovereign power was at stake.'’—
Let the young reader observe, that aqor is often used thus, as
reS, fortuna, honor, aqitur.

⁸⁰ Itaque σφα] Livy often uses such synonymous words as
these3 so, jam nune, ita sic, ᾇτ’.

⁸¹ Minime qratum spectaculum] This was far from being a
show calculated to amuse, such as a show of gladiators, or the
like.

Β Nee his nec illis periculum suum ; publicum imperium ser-
vitiumque obversatur anima] Sed is understood before publicum,
an omission not unusual in Livy in passages like this. Some
late copies introduce it, though it is not to be found in the best
MSS. and old editions.

’Β Perstrinqit] ‘⁴ Stuns ;” or “ wrings.’' Torpebat, “was
suspended-”

⁸⁴ Telorum armorumque] “ Weapons and armour.'’ Arma
from armus, “ the shoulder,'’ or ἄξω, “ to fit on,'’ meant what pro·
tected the body. Tela, from τῆλε, procul, properly meant “ mis-
sile weapons.'’ Arma was a general epithet to express every
thing that defended the person, and annoyed the enemy; but it
was often taken in a limited sense, as here, to signify defensive
amour, and is then opposed to tela. So coquatus properly meant
any relation by blood, and was often taken in a limited sense to.
