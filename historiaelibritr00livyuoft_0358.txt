not of the greatest difficulty, they were embarrassed a short time
before;’' ι’. e. when the deputies of the senate spoke to thern·-
Trepz‘dare is generally used to signify that trepidation and tur-
bulence of feeling which is experienced on the eve of a battle—³
See B. 2. c. 46, 49.

⁷³ Proximi invidia] “Most obnoxious to the animosity of the
patriciam-’⁹ Invidia is very often used in a passive sense, to
signify that hatred and hostility felt and exercised against-one
by another.—-See c. 542

⁷⁴ Non minore moi-za] They were no less exasperated and
prox-oked to secession by the recollection of the murder of
Dentatus, than by the attack on Virginia.

⁷⁵ Proeroqativam] “ Lest the comitia in the city might
follow the precedent of the assembly that elected the mili-
tary tribunes, by creating those same persons tribunes of the
people.” When the centuries were called on to vote, they origi-
nally came according to the institution of Servius Tullius, first
the equites, then the centuries of the first class, then the centu-1
ries of the second, &c.; afterwards, however, the order (but when
is uncertain) was determined by lot. The century first called on
by lot was called proeroqaz‘iva ,· the rest were styled jure vocam«
The vote of the proeroqatz'va was considered of great importance,
and it was often followed by the other centuries3 hence the word
often means “ a precedent,” “ a choice,” or “ favour,’' “a pledge
or omen of any thing future ;’' and among later writers, ⁰‘ an
exclusive privilege.” Sometimes the tribes are mentioned in the

omitia centuriata ; and then it is supposed that, after the cent-u-
ries were included in the tribes, (see B. 1. c. 43. n.) the tribes
cast lots first, and that tribe, which first came out, was called
proeroqativa tribus, and the others, jure vocatoe tribus ,- then the
centuries of the proeroqatz’va tribus cast lots, to ascertain which
should be the praeroqaz‘iva centuria. After the proeroqativa oen-
mria of the prceroqativa tribus voted‚ then the other centuries voted
according to their property ι first the centuries of the first class,
then of the second, δια, as they did when there was no men·
tion made of tribes. The jure vocata> tribus were those tribes
whose centuries voted, not by lot, but in their just ‘and
regular order (hence jure vocatae) according to their rank and
property.—See B. 5. 18.-B. 21. 3.—B. 27. 6.-Β. 28. 9.-Οίθ,
