is the same as nepotes et liberos. So in Greek, υἷες ’Axati-Ty, ψευδὲς
fau-3139, &a for’Axoem), ιάιτξοὶ, δίο.

⁶¹ Si affinitatis inter vos] This sudden and unexpected
transition from the third to the second person is strongly ex-
pressive of the hurry and ardour of the speaker3 it is considered a
great beauty in poetry. See instances of it in the notes on ch. 57.

ω Vidzcae aut orbae.] Widows, if we lose our husbands3 or-
phans, if we lose our fathers.

⁶² Tamen] “ However, that some benefit may be eonferred
on the Sabines by the union,” Rome having derived the chief
advantage from it.

⁹ ⁶4 Ubi primzlm ex profundd emersus palude equus Curtium in
vado statuit, Curtium lacum appelldrunt] “As a memorial of.
that battle, they called the place, where his horse, after having
emerged from the deep morass, placed Curtius in a shallow (i. e.
a safe) place, lacus Curtius-‚⁹⁹ The place afterwards retained
this name even when filled up and dry. Livy. B. 7. c. 6, gives
another reason for the name, viz. that it was called from Curtius
springing in armed and on horseback, several hundred years after,
into a gulph that suddenly opened in the forum ; it being imagined
that it would not close until an offering was made of what was
most valuable in the state, i. e. a warrior armed and on horse-
back. Equum Curtius . . . statuit is another reading-Sigonius
would read equum Curtius in vado destituit, because Plutarch says,
,καὶ {aiom τὸν ἵππον, ἓαυτδν ἐ’σωσε. But Livy and Plutarch may
give different accounts of the occurrence, by following different
authorities.

ὣ Curias triqinta] First, he divided the whole body of the
people into three tribes, (so called either from their number, or
the tribute which they paid,) and each tribe, into ten euriae.

⁶⁸ Nomina earum curiis imposuit] Varro and Plutarch deny
this fact.

⁶⁷ Id non traditur, de] “ As the number of Sabine women was
undoubtedly somewhat greater than this number of curiae, it is
not handed down to us whether they, who should give names to
the curiae, were appointed from their age, &ef

⁶⁸ Ramnenses, ᾀσ] These were the names of the three tribes
from which these centurie-s were taken. The Ramnenses were
those who came with Romulus from Alba3 Tatienses, those who
came with Tatius3 Luceres were all other strangerS, so called,
either From Lucumo, a. Tuscan‚ who joined Romulus with a power-
ful force 3 (see c. 12, n. 50 3) or from lucus, ‘⁶ the grove or asylum”
to which most of those foreigners had at first fled for protection.
Dion, who is followed by Plutarch in his Life of Romulus, says,
that the people were divided lnto tribes before this. It would,
says Crevier, appear from Livy, that thjs was the first time the
division was made. The two authors may be thus reconciled, by
supposing that, though the division was made before, yet, as by
