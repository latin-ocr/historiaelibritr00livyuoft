NOTEs ‘ro Boon 1. e. 28, 29, 30. 87

⁸⁷ Vivo tibi ea disciplina ἂ me adhibita ess-effi] “ I would allow
you to live, and have given you such a lesson.’'

³³ Animum ancipitem] “ A mind divided between the interests
of the Romans and the Fidenatians.''

³⁹ Quadriqis] This word means four horses joined by one
yoke 3 sometimes the chariot drawn by them. But here it means
“ a team of four horses.'’

⁴⁰ Qua inhacerant] “ Bearing off the mangled body on each
chariot, where the limbs had been tied by the chords.”

⁴¹ Supplicium exempli parum memoris lequm humanarum] “ A
-punishment that established a precedent, which showed a dis-
regard for the laws of humanity.'‘

cmp- ΧὶῑίΙΧ.--42 Inter baa] The superior elegance of this
description is well worth the reader’s attention. For Albam some
copies have Albani.

⁴³ Silentium triste ac tacita moestitia] These words are not
synonymous3 their silence did not proceed from quietness, but
deep sorrow and affliction3 and their grief was not expressed iu
shrieks or lamentatione», but buried deep within their breasts.

⁴⁴ Ultimum illud.] “For that last time.'’ Val- Flac. B. 4. v.
253, has extremum lzoc, and Curtius, B. 4. c. 11, hoe ter-
tium. Cicero ad Attio. 13. 46, hoc primum. Some, for illud,
read illas.

⁴⁵ Ultimis urbis partibus] It is better to connect these words
with diruebantur than with audiebatur ,· and the next words, ex
distantibus locis, justify this opinion. The work of demolition
commenced on the skirts of the city3 and the crash, heard from
thence, conveyed the news.

⁴⁶ Quibus quisque poterat elatis] A Graecism for iis, quoe
quisque poterat, elatis. So B. 4. c. 3, quibus poterat sauciis
ductis secum. In Greek the relative commonly agrees with its
antecedent in ease.

⁴⁷ Larem ac penates-J Lar was a Tuscan word, signifying
head of his family, or prince of his people. The head of any
family or tribe was generally deified after death, and thought to
protect the family, and his image was kept in the house. The
Lares therefore were of human origin, being no more than the
deified ancestors of the family. The Penates were the tutelary
gods of the family, and were of divine origin.

⁴⁸ Quadringentorum] Livy agrees with Virgil, who counts
three hundred years from the foundation of Alba to the time of
Romulus, AEn. 1. 272. But Dionysius and others say it flour-
“ ished 487 years. ⁷

⁴⁹ Templis temperatum est] Templis is hereadative. A templis
would be equally good Latin. So we say to spare a thing, or
efrain from it.

CnAr. XXX.-⁵⁰ Frequentius habitaretur] “ That it may be
more thickly inhabited.”
