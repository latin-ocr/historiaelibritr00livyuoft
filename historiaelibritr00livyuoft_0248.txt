230 No‘rns To noox 11. c. 59, 60, 61.

So San. Cat. c. 65, reliqua siqua in subsidiis ανοέὶτὶε collocat.
This is the explanation generally given for siqua in this place.
But 1 think the word ought rat-her to be taken in its usual
sense, to mean the standards3 accordingly he says after, siquo
amisso siqniferos, <5⁹⁶- As each manipulus consisted of two com·
panies‚ ordines or centuriae, it is natural to think it had one stan-
dard for each.

⁹⁷ Straqem] This word sometimes means a heap of any
bodies thrown down—See B. 7. c. 23.—B. 8. c. 30.-—-B. 35.
c. 30.—B. 40. c. 2.—-Virg. AEn. 12. 453. Here the soldiers,
who in their hurry and confusion were thrown down, are called
ειν es.

&Quum revocando ...... persecutus esset] “After he
had in vain persisted in calling back his men.”—See Β. 3. 20. n.

Β Haud falsa] He was true in calling them deserters.

¹ Duplicarzos.] These were soldiers who were rewarded for
some services with a double allowance of bread. It was usual
with the Romans and Spartans to reward valour in this way.
See B. 7. c. 37.-B. 24. c. 47.—Herod. B. 6. 57. The Spartan
king had always a double portion of food at the public feast, that
he might be able to reward any person he pleased for his merit.

CHAP. LX.—2 Tum duci] Walker explains this passage (in
my opinion, very strangely‚) thus : duci nempe addictus, Patribus
placatior: namque exercitus Quinctio nunquam fuerat iratus.
De Ῐιᾶσ specie ellfipseos vid. Sanc-t. Min. 1. 4. c. 8. 1 think it
more simple and consistent with the genius of the language to
make duci governed by placatior, thus: Quinctianus exercitus
rediit tum duci placatior, tum propter ducem Patribus quoque
placatior, quam Appianas exercitus.

³ Res major.] “A matter which was more important from
the victory gained by the plebeians in the contest they engaged
in, than from any real advantage accruing from it 3⁵⁹ though
Livy said before, that it was an important matter, as the pa-
tricians lost all power of creating whatever tribunes they pleased 3
see c. 56. He does not however here contradict himself3 be-
cause, though they did lose it, yet, as they generally found one
or more of the tribunes to lend themselves to them in thwarting
the measures of the rest by the power of intercession, that loss
was of little consequence. Thus Walker explains the passage. -

CHAP. Ι.ΧΙ.---4 Tanquam tertia] The consuls were favour-
able to the law; but Appius, as if he were a third consul, opposed
the tribunes.

⁵ Diem dixere] “Appointed him a day to stand his trial.”
The charges against him were, that he proposed in the senate
measures injurious to the people ; that he had been exciting se-
dition3 that he had laid violent hands on the sacred person of a
tribune (see c. 56); and that through his means the Roman arms
were defeated and disgraced.
