Nonas ’ro' BOOK 11. c. 59. 229

temes, the language of Livy, who speaks of all the army
without reserve or exception, opposes such an unnatural junction
and reference. Indeed Walker‚ by the words defendi potest,
seems to have some misgivings as to the correctness of the word
alii. One MS. has alio, which in the margin is corrected to alio-
quin. Perizonius corrects the word to at. Now Ι cannot help
observing, that, if those readings be thought obj ectionable, at ille
(scil. miles Romanus or exercitus), or at hi, would be better than
this nntenable word alii. No mistake could more easily occur in
MSS. where words are abbreviated3 a point, or stroke, serving
ψ for a letter3 and one compound letter for many. So the sense
of the passage I take to be this. The whole army were glad to
be defeated to spite their commander, and fled before the enemy.
When their entrenchments were attacked‚ they reluctantly ex-
erted themselves to repulse the enemy, so that it was evident,
that Roman soldiers (a word equivalent to men of superior valour,
unused to defeat or shame,) were willing to submit to every thing
except the capture of their camp. But their defeat and disgrace
they were glad of, aye, the Roman soldiers were glad of it.
Their unwillingness that the camp should be taken, did not, I
think, proceed, as Crevier imagines, from any feeling of pride,
(for that it appears they had not, and, if they had, it was suffi-
ciently humbled by their defeat,) but a selfish self-interest. At
this time every Roman soldier was obliged to support himself,
and had with him in the camp some of his property, his food, his
arms, vessels, and furniture3 so that the loss of the camp, not to
say that it would expose him to the inclemency of the weather,
would depr-ive him of a portion of his fortune. However, Ι wish
the reader to consult his own taste and judgment on this point.
The only thing contended for is the incorrectness of the word
aliz· and of Walker’s explanation.

⁹³ Experiri] “ Put his power to the proof.’'

⁹⁴ Nihil praeter tempus noxoe lucrarentur] “ Since they gained
nothing but a respite of their punishment. Noxa sometimes
means “punishment for an act.” So, B. 8. c. 33, exime-re noxc'e.
Ovid, noxae deditus hostis. Crevier thinks 710oeae is the subject
to lucrarentur, and here means “the guilty soldiers? as servitia
is sometimes put for servi, operae for operarii, διο. See B. 3.
c. 15 n. Walker rejects this interpretation, not knowing of
any authority for this use of the word; yet Cic. (Ver. 5. 75,)
gives it this meaning, noxa est corpus quod nocuit, id est, servus ;
noxia ipsum maleficium, veluti furtum; and Justinian, Instit. 4.
8, gives the word a like definition.—See Facciolati’s Lexicon.

⁹⁵ Quum martinia] ⁴⁶ Particularly at the time when.''

⁹⁵* Eo pavore ...... ut.] “ With such fear . . . that ”

’ὃ Siqnaque et ordines] “ Both the battalions and companies.’'
As each manipulus had a standard, (siqnum), siqnum is sometimes
used in the sense of manipulum—See B. 25. c. 23.--B. 33. c. 9.
