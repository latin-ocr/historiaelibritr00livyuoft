NOTES TO BOOK 11.

-————-

eme. 1.-ι Imperia] This is not taken here in its proper
sense, which is “ military command.”

² Proxima reqis superbia] Proximi is another reading, per-
haps a more natural one.

³ Omnes deinceps conditores partium certe urbia] “ That they
may all in suecession be deservedly counted founders of the
several parts, at least, of the city, which they added to it, as being
intended as new seats for the multitude, which was increased by
themselves.” Certe mem, that though they were not entitled

pessimo publico cedificatiS, certant—Gen. B. 7. c. 3. Catone id,
quod optimum esse publicum existimabat, suadente—Tacit. An-
nal. B. 3. e. 70. Capito insiqnitior infamia fuit, quod eqre-
yium publicum et bonus domi artes dehonestat-isset :--b0num pub-
licum and malum publicum are phrases often used.

⁵ Sub tutela inviolati templi] i. e. The asydum.

⁶ Cui lonqo tempore assuescitur] “To which people become
familiarized only by length of time.’' Let the young reader
