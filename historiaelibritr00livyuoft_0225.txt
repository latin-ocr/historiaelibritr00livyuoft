No‘rns ‘ro BOOK 11. c. 34, 35. 207

²⁰ Haud tam facile dictu est, faciendumne fuerit] “ It is not so
easy to say whether this thing ‘ ought' to have been done, as Ι
am of opinion it could have been done, namely, that the patricians,
on condition of reducing the price of provisions, might have
freed themselves from the tribunician power, and all the laws
imposed upon them against their will?

CHAP. XXXV-³¹ Fame se jam, sicut hostes, peti] “That
they were assailed by the patricians with famine, as if they were
public enemies.”

⁸² Nisi de terqo . . . . . satisfiat] “ Unless eorporal punishment
'were inflicted on (or satisfaction taken on the backs of) the
Roman populace.” The surrender of the tribunes, their only
protectors, would lead to this. The words de terqo are used by
Livy in several places to imply the punishment of flogging.—
See c. 29, at the end; they are opposed to caput, which meant
“ beheading,” or any punishment that took away life.

³⁸ Carnzficem] “ Executioner.” Coriolanus is meant.

³⁴ Diem dixissent] ‘⁶ Appointed him a day to stand his trial.”
These words are often used by Livy to signify this

³⁵ Ibat] “Thereupon.”·-—See c. 31. n. 80.

³⁶ Auxilia] See B. 3. c. 30. n.

³⁷ Plebisque] That they were elected to assist and protect
the plebeians, not to punish the patricians.

³⁸ Unius poenci defunqendum esset] ‘⁶ That the patricians were
obliged to escape danger by giving up one to punishment.”—See
a similar use of the verb, B. 4. c. 52. Β. 3. c. 5 3-a’aroekadrerm
and ἀπαλλάττεσθαι are used in the same sense. The charge

δὲἓωίεἰῖεξὲιῗέᾂῖφῗέῃῗιτῖεῗ] ῒῖίθῗῗὶοθῒ made a stand, however, not-
withstanding the public odium which was excited against them3
and they all exerted as well the powers of the whole order, as,
every individual, his own.” Adversa invidia is an abl. absolute,
like advers-d voluntate before, B. 1. c. 46.

⁴⁰ Qud-qudfl Scil. parte ,· usi viribus εᾶ tenus parte, quate-
nus possidebant vire-5¹, is the way in which this ellipsis is filled up.
The words are taken adverbially, and signify the same as tum-
tum, ‘⁶ as well—as?

⁴¹ Disjicere rem] “ To prevent or quash the business.” So
disjicere consilium, B. 25. c. 14.

*Β Quicquid erat patrum, reos diceres] “ You would say that
all the patricians, that were in existence, were under impeach-
ment? Thus Hor. B. 2. Sat. 6. Lydorum quicquid—So also
ch. 49. Quicquid deorum—See B. 3. c. 17. Quod has often the
same force·

⁴³ Pro nocente donarent] “ Make his pardon, as a guilty man,
a present to themselves.”--Pardon him, as if guilty, in compli-
ment to themselves—See the same use of the word, B. 8. c, 12,
35, and condonare, B. 3. c. 12, andin Caesar, Bell. Gall. B. 1,. c. 20.
