X NOTES TO PREFACE.

'¹ Nomini officient] Shall be a bar to my celebrity.

⁸ Ut quae supra septenqentesimum] “As it is a subJeet that
must be carried back beyond the seven hundredth year.'’ There
are two reasons why the subject is said to be one,of immense
labour3 first, it must be carried back to the darkness of antiquity,
where there can be but little light to guide a writer, and must
embrace all the events that have taken place for seven hundred
years3 secondly, rising from small beginnings, when, in the early
ages of the city, the facts of its history were neither numerous
nor important, it has by degrees, according as the empire has
become great, grown to such an extent, as to become unmanage-
able from the number and importance of the facts to be detailed.
Praevalentis, “ grown to an excess of power.” Walker says, that
the construction of the sentence is, res est et immensi operis, ut
quae sup. sep. an. repet. et (immensi operis) ut quae ab exiquis, &c-
But Crevier, 1 think more correctly, sayS, that either et before im-
mensi is to be expunged, or that the arrangement is this. res est
et immensi operis (ut qnoe sup. sep. an. rep. ., et nt quoe ab ez. pr.
in. εδ cr. ut jam may. lab. ειιίὶ) et leyentium plerisque . The
et before immensi operis refers to the et before leqentium; and
thus the two clauses are connected. Livy mentions the diffi-
culties and disadvantages he has to encounter in his undertaking.
It is one of immense labonr, for which he gives two reasons3 and
it is one, he is sure, in which his taste and feelings would not cor-
respond with those of most of his readers; as they carelessly and
impatiently hurry over the first periods of the history, that they may
arrive at those late and interesting events, during the occurrence
of which the state fell a victim to its own overwhelming power.
But he, on the contrary, would dwell with more pleasure on those
distant scenes3 for then he would be relieved from the painfiil view
of the evils to which the age he lived in was a witness3 and also
from an uneasy apprehension (curae) of incurring, by the facts
he should detail, the displeasure or hostility of any man or party
of his time. Proeterea refers to the fust line, facturusne, &c- '

⁹ Condendamve] ‘⁴ Or about to be built? i. e. before the
time of Romulus.

¹⁰ fllaqis decora fabulis] “ More worthy to embellish the
fables of poets, than the pure records of history. So c. 42.
Ῐιιιηο ordinem vel paee decorum vel bello.

¹¹ Si cuz· populo licere oportet] “If any people ought to be
allowed to represent their origin as sacred, and attribute it to the
agency of the gods, the Romans are that people3 for so great is
the milit-ary glory theyv have acquired, that foreign nations allow
as calmly, as >they submit to their dominion‚ that they were
descended from the go'd of war, whom, above all others, they
represent as their own parent, ¹and that of their founder
Romulus.”
