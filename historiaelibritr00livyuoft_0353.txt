NOTEs 'ro Boon:> 111. c. 45, 46. 335

Virginius hold forth as a plea for their demand, shows clearly
how favourable he himself was to liberty. But that liberty would
find firm security in it in this way only, if it did not vary in
causes or persons :³⁷ ἱ. e. to continue undeviating and invariable
ν in the tenor of its operation to those causes and persons only to
which it was intended to be applied. Appius says that the friends
of Virginius were wresting the law to cases and persons to which
it was inapplicable. “For in the case of those who (being in
slavery) were claimed as free, that right (which was above de-
manded by Virginia’s advocates) did exist, because any citizen
00an by law bring such an acti0n3 but in the case of her who

was in her father’s hands, there was no other person to whom v

her master should yield the custody of her ;’' consequently she
could not, pending the suit, be set at liberty. A slave could not
bring an action at law against his master to recover his freedom ;
some free citizen should do it for him, and any citizen might do
it. Appius says, that, if Virginia was living in a state of slavery
under Claudius, as any one might institute an action to establish
her liberty, she would be entitled to her liberty until the affair
was decided; but as she wasnow living under her father’s pro-
tection, and he was absent, and as no other person had a right
to defend or keep her, she should be given up to the man who
claimed to be her master, until the father’s arrival.
