88 NOTEs rro Boon 1. c. 30.

⁵¹ In Patr-ea] “Into the body of patricans.’' And if there
were any vacancies in the senate, he appointed Albans to fill them.
⁵⁵ Tullios] In place of this family, Dionysius mentions the
Julian family, Julios ,· but Livy and others show that these came
to Rome before this time3 indeed Tullios and Julios are often
confounded in MSS.
⁵³ Templumque ordini ab se aucto curiamfhcit.] ‘⁶ And, as a
consecrated place of meeting for this order thus augmented by
himself, he built a senate-house, which was called the Hostilian,
leven to the time of our fathers-’'—See AEn. 7. 174. He calls
the senate-house templum to show that it was a consecrated place,
where the senators were to ass-emble under the sanction and
sacred character of religion. This, which was a rujn, was in
the time of Julius Caesar repaired and called Julia, scil. curia.—
Curia is derived from curare, ‘⁶ to manage the public business.”
As there is no mention made in any other author that he in·
creased the number of senators, Crevier imagines that the words
imply that he increased the number of families from whom sena-
tors were ehosen.
⁵⁴ Equitum decem turmas] Tur-ma (qu. terna, ὰ teret dem‘.)
was a body of thirty horse. Milton, Paradise Regained, B. 4. 66,
uses the word turm :

⁶⁴ Legions and whom, tur-ms of horse and wings.”

Here it may not be improper to observe, that legions and cohorts
mean the infantry of Romans and allies ς turms of horse and
wings, the cavalry of Romans and allies. The cavalry of the
Roman army were generally called alae, “wings,'’ though, εω-
cording to Lipsius, De Militia Romami, B. 2. c. 7, the word was
sometimes used to signify any body of troopS, whether horse or
foot, posted to defend the flanks ; and such troops were generally
those of the allies, because they were mostly, if not always,
posted on both flanks, and so formed a sort of wings to the main
body. When legions and cohorts are mentioned together, ‘legions
usually meant the Roman foot, and cohorts meant the infantry
of the alnes-,3 so the cavalry of the allies were mostly called
alarii, or alarii equites, to distinguish them from the Roman
cavalry, who were called leqionarii equites. This is the view in
which this passage of Milton must be taken, which has, like
many others, been overlooked or misunderstood by his commen-
tators.

⁸⁵ Eodem supplmnem‘o] i. e. “ The Albans.''

⁵⁶ Feroniae] The same as Juno. She was worshipped by the
Latins and Sabines in common at the foot of the hill Soracte.

⁵⁸ Suos priris in lucum confuqisse] “ The Sabines complained
that, before that event, their own people fied into the asylum.’'
The Sabines alleged that they had the first cause of complaint.

⁵⁸ Et· ipsi] i. e. As the Romans had been strengthened by
