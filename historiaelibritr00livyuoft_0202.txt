184 NOTES To Boon 11. c. 5.

⁴¹ Desectam] “A great number of men, sent into it in a
body, cut it down, both grain and straw‘, and threw it with
baskets into the Tiber.’'

⁸ Inde paullatim et aliia] “ Gradually by means of this and
other things.'’

⁴⁴ Manuque adjutam] “It was aided by the labour of
human hands.” This island lay between Rome and the Janicu-
lum3 it was called the sacred island, insula sacra, from the
number of temples on it.

⁴⁸ Miserebatque non poenae maqis homines, ᾳιιᾶπι sceleris] “And
men felt pity not more on account of their punishment than
their guilt,” because they looked upon this guilt as proceeding
not so much from any bad principle, as from some blind
infatuation.

⁴⁵ Illos, θα] These are the reflections of the people.

⁴⁴¹ Eminente] “ While the feelings of parental affection
appeared evident during the discharge of his duty in inflicting
public punishment.'’ Drakenborch says the passage means,
that, while he superintended the public punishment of his sons, his
stern mind, though he was their father, was a more remarkable
spectacla than his stern countenance3 i. e. animo eminente supra
spectaculum oris. But, though Dionysius and others represent
him as obdurate and unmoved, this meaning seems improbable,
as how could his firmness of mind be seen except by his steadi-
ness of eountenanee? besides, it is scarcely credible that on
such au occasion he did not evince some symptoms of humanity

Livy intended to convey a different idea of Brutus from what
Dionysius did.

⁴⁸ Secundzlm paenam] “Next after punishing the guilty, in
order that there may be a signal example on both sides for the
prevention of crimes, there were given, as a reward to t-he infor-
mer, a sum of money out of the treasury, his freedom, and admis-
sion to the privileges of a citizen.

⁴⁹ Vindicta] This was the rod which was laid ou the head of
a slave by the praetor before he emancipated him. When a
master wished to emancipate a slave, the usual method waS, to
bring him before the magistrate, and say, “ Ι wish this man to
be free.” The magistrate then, putting a rod on his head, said
“ he is free.” Whereupon the lictor, or the master, turning him
round in a circle (which was called vertiqo) and giving him a
blow on the cheek, (alapa‚) let him go,

⁵⁰ Post illum] “ After him it became a rule duly observed,
that those who were emancipated in this way, should be consi-
dered as admitted to the privileges of the state.” He uses the
word ita, as there was another mode of emancipation instituted
by Servius, called per censum, when the name of a slave, with the
