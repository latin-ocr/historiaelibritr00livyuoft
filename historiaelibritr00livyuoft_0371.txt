¹⁵ Reddent ac restituent] “ Restm-e you what you lost, and re-
establish it in its former security? Thaee words are not purely
synonymous here.

⁴⁵ Criminum in principem] “ Accusations against the nobles.”

⁴⁷ Re.] “ In property ;” fortuna, in general condition or rank.

⁴⁸ A quibus semper . . . tuti sitia] “ From the effects of thch
you have been guarded .” He says that the tribunes were
always involving the plebeians with the patricianS, that they may
always stand in need of their protection.

⁴⁹ stipendia] See c. 27. 11. 37. Τ110 best writers are fond of
applying the words in use in their time to the times of which
they are speaking. Thus Homer in the Iliad speaks of trumpets
and dexterous horsemen, though there were 110 511011 things known
at the time of the Trojan war3 and Milton speaks of 031111011 and
all the instruments of modern warfare in 1115 description of the
battle of the angels.

⁵⁰ Acies] This word, derived from ἀκῆ, properly means the
“ edge” of any thing 3 hence it means “ an army drawn out in even
line of battle ;” hence “ a battle itself ;” a cutting edge being the
best figurative epithet to apply to the havoc of war. Milton,
{rho has adopted all the metaphors, and idioms, and images of
the ancient 01355105, 11505 the word in its original sense, Par„
Lost, 6. 1073

 

“ before the cloudy van,
On the rough edge os battle, ere it join’d,

Satan, with vast and haughty strides, advanc’d‚
Came town-ing, armed in adamant 31111 gold.” ,

 

Here the host is described as wearing a gloomy aspect, which is,
thought to contradict a description immediater preceding:

“ Far 111 th' horizon to the north appear'd,
From skirt to 511111, afiery region, stretched
In battailous aspect, and nearer view,
Bristled with upright beams innumerable,
Of rigid spears, and helmets thronged, and shieids
Vanus, with boastful argument pourtrasu
The banded pow’rs of Satan, hasting ou
With furious expeditionff

 

 

And, a few lines after, Satan is represented as
“ Enclosed with flaming cherubim 31111 golden shields.’ '

But there is really no contradiction. The gloom is caused mostly,
by the dense multitude that cast a shade before· it3 the rough-
ness‚ by the bristling or irregular appearance which is expressed.
by horresco in Latin, and φςίσσω 111 Greek3 31111 the 1131110, by the.
