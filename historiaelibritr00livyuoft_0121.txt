mony or sacrifice of the suovetaurilia) was called the closing of
the lustrum.'‘ Lustrum included every thing belonging to the
censu57 as appears by the next line—Quia refers to conditum,
from condere “to end,'’ so Virg. Ecl. 9. 52, cantando puerum
memini me condere soles.

¹⁸ Fabius Pictor] The most ancient of the Roman historians.
He lived in the second Punic war. There were however certain
chronicles and annals before his time.—Sec Β. 4. c. 3.

¹⁹ Deinceps auqet Esquilias] “ Then in continuation he en-
larges the Esquiliae,'' i. e. with more buildings and inhabitants.
Gronovius reads Esquiliis, i. e. he enlarges the city by taking in
the Esquiliae. Deinceps means that the Esquiline was a conti-
nuation of the Viminal-

²⁰ Postmaerium.] i. e. The space “ behind” or outside the wall.
Livy says that it is not the “ only’' meaning of the word, but
that. it properly means the space on both sides of the wall. He
does “ not'' deny that the word comes from post and murus, but
he denies the correctness of the interpretation of these words.

²¹ Continuarentur] should be erected close to the walls.

²² Conjunqunt] Form a part of them.

CHAP. XLV—2³ Quum eonsensum deosque consociatos laudaret
mir-‘3² Servius inter proceres Latinorum] Servius admired the
great concord and the friendly alliance‚ as it were, between their
gods, i. e. the unanimity in point of religion, that subsisted be-
tween the Latin chiefs.—Now this union in religion he saw
was the foundation and best cement of politica] alliance‚ and it
was for the purpose of attaching to himself these states of the
Latins by the bond of a common religion, that he prevailed on them
to build in conjunction with the Romans a temple at Rome
to Diana, whom they were to worship together3 and as Rome
was thus made the seat of their common religion, it was a con-
fession that it was the capital of their united states. This, I
think, is the meaning of this passage.

²⁴ Romae fanum Diam] This, says Dionysius, was on the
Aventine.

ἦ Id quanquam] Though the Latins gave up all thoughts of
this pre-eminence.

'³⁵ Fors dara] “ An accidental opportunity of recovering
power by a scheme of his own seemed to offer itself to one of
the Sabines.'' These, as well as the Latins, were struggling with
the Romans for pre-eminence. This, which the Latins had re-
signed all hope of, the Sabine thought he could obtain for his
own state. I do not think, as most commentators suppose, that
he here confounds the Latius and Sabines.

²¹ Fixa ...... cornum] They were hung up after she was slain.

²⁸ Dianoe immolasset] i. e. To Diana, whose temple was built
on the Aventine.

ὃ Incesta] “ Without previous pufification.”
