LIFE OF LIVY. V

The first decade is extant, commencing with the history
of Rome, and embracing a period of four hundred and
sixty years; the second, which comprehended a period of
only seventy- -five years, and the principal occurrences of
which were the first Punic war, is lost; the third, con-
taining a minute and eloquent detail of the second Punic
war, the longest, and most hazardous, as he says, in
which the fortunes of the state were ever committed, is
extant ;- the fourth, embracing a space of twenty-three
years only, from the variety and importance of the
events which are recorded, and containing an account of
the Macedonian war against Philip, and the Asiatic
against Antiochus, is also extant3 of the fifth, only the
first five books are preserved, and these very imperfect.

Macedon, whose kingdom, after various vicissitudes of
defeat and success, is -at length reduced to a Roman
province3 of the third Punic war, which lasted only
five years3 and of the corruption, cruelty, and extortion
of several Roman governors in the provinceS, and their
Subsequent punishment. The rest, except the epitomes,
are all lost.

materialsp, which he had leady for use at this epoch, were
more numerous and certain than at any former period.
He could not only consult the ordinary annals of the
times, and the records os the senate, but could draw
from the ample fountains of his ovm knowledge, and of
that of his illustrious cotemporaries, who mixed and

times. Besides, he could find easy access to the Memoirs
