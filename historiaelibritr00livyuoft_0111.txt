et aditurfaciliora.—Some copies incorrectly read additum in
place of aditu.

⁸ Discrimine reete an perperam faeti confusa] “The dis-
tinction of right and wrong being 0011founded,” and consequently
disregarded.

CnAP. XXXIV.—⁷ anorans nurum ventremferre.] “When
he died without notieing his grandchild in his will, as he did not
know that his daughter-in-law was pregnant.'' Venter and uterus
are often figuratively used to signify partus. So Tacit. Annal. B.
1. c. 59, subjectus servitio uxoris uterus.-An. 15. c. 23, senatus
. uterum Poppz‘ae commendaverat diis.-See Drakenborch for an ac-
count of the variation here in the statements of Livy and Dionysius·

Β Divitiae animos facerent] “WVhen riches gave him high
notions, Tanaquil enlarged those high notions.'’

⁹ Haud facile iis.] “Who could not easily bear that her
condition after marriage should be lower than that in which she
was born ;’' i. e. that her husband should be inferior to her
family. Rhenanus reads innupsisset in place of illi nupsisset.
Gronovius, who is followed by others, reads humiliora sineret
ea quae innupsisset. Spernentibus, ᾇτ’. According to him, quae
innupsisset must be used for quibus innupsisset.

⁹ '¹ In novo.] We must conceive volvebat in animo Tana-
quil, οι· the like, understood. Futurum—understand esse de-
pending on the suppressed clause.

¹⁰ Sabine matre] As she was the daughter of Numa, who
was a Sabine. No mention being any where made of the father
of Ancus, Seneca says, Ep. 108, Anci pater nullus.

¹¹ Unci imagine] “He could only produce the single image
of Numa to entitle him to nobility.'' No one was considered
noble who could not show images of his ancestors3 and no one
was allowed to have an image, who had not filled one of the
highest offices in the state.

¹² Ut cupido honorum] “As being a man naturally ambi-
tious of honours, and as Tarquinii was only his mother's coun-
try.’' He had no strong natural tie to bind him to Tarquinii;
his mother only was a native of the place, and this was not a
sufficient inducement to keep him there. Cupidus, a, um.

¹³ Ministerio.] “ As if sent by divine command to perform
that office.'’ ·

¹4 Eaecelsa et altra] In this sense μετέωρα and ὑψηλὰ are
used together by Longinus and others. ,

¹⁵ Eam alitem] “ That such a bird from such a quarter of the
sky, and the messenger of such a deity, (i. e. Jupiter, to whom
the eagle was sacred,) had come.'’ All these were omens of his
future greatneSS. An accusative with an infinithe, when the
verb on which it depends is understood, is very usual in excla-
matione, or to express any quick or strong emotion. So virgil,
AEn. l. 41, mene incepto desistere victam.
