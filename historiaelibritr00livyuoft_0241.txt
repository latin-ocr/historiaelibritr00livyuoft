⁸⁵ Abeuntes maqistratu On. Genucius arripuit] In most editions,

¹ we find consules in place of Cn„ but erroneously. Glareanus
gives an important passage from Dionysius, B. 8. p. 544, which
throws great light on the history of this period, and supplies a
serious omission of Livy here and in chapter 41. In the year 269,
during the consulship of Sp. Cassius and Proc. Virginius, a decree
of the senate was passed, appointing ten commissioners of consular
rank to mark out the public lands, and determine how much should
be divided between the people and allies, <both to have an equal
right to it,) and what should be each man's share. The consuls
of the subsequent years were annually to appoint such commis—
sioners, who should in the same way regulate any land that
might from time to time be gained by the Romans and allies con-
jointly. This decree was allowed by all the consuls aster to
remain a dead letter3 and it was for not enforcing it that Genu-
cius arraigned the last consuls. Probably he wlshed, by this
example, to terrify into a eompliance the present consuls, who,
while in office, could not be impeached.

³⁶ Ampuit] This word is applied to a person who is viru-
lently and suddenly accused. So, B. 3. 58.--Suet. in Caes. c. 23.
It properly means to snatch at or seize quickly and violently,
perhaps like a dog.

’Β Οἰνωηιεαηέ . . . . . non plebem maqis qudm juniores
patrum] Th0ugh this is the reading of all the editions and
commentator-S, yet Ι cannot avoid expressing my opinion, that, in
place of plebem, patres, (which three MSS„ i. e. Palat. Secund„
Harlej. Secund„ and Haverk. give,) would be better, and agree
more with the whole scope of the following statement. Livy
does not give their address to the plebeians, (a presumptive proof
that. they did not address them,) and the address to the patricians
is a severe attack on the plebeians. It is not likely they would
supplicate and abuse them at the same time. It is equally mani-
fest that the plebeians were highly incensed against them3 and
that their supporters, the patriciam, intended to carry the point,
not by supplicatory appeal or reasoning with the peopie, but by
violence and treachery. The consuls, not calculating on the
populace, rested their only hope in enlisting on their side the
“ whole²’ strength of the patrician interest, not only the “elder”pa-
