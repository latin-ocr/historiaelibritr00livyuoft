connexion should be, numinis consulti nunc extis, (5¹0, employing
consulti in the sense of “ being advised or directed, or answered.”
So Virg. AEn. 3. 452, inconsulti abeunt, sedemque odere Sibylloe ,⁶
where inconsulti refers to the strangers who received no answer
or counsel. In English the word ‘¹ counselled” is applied to a
person who receives an answer for his advice or direction.
According to this explanation the meaning of the passage is, “the
soothsayers being answered or directed by the gods, publicly and
privately, (ἱ. e. in their public and private sacrifices‚) at one time
by means of entrails, at another time through birds, declared
that there was no other cause for the resentment of the divinity
(moti ἰνᾶ numinis) than, &0¹⁹ ,

¹⁷ Εὸ evasere] ‘⁶ Went so far?⁹ Althongh the soothsayers
declared that the sole cause of the anger of the deity was, that
the sacred rites were not properly performed, from which was to
be inferred, that the immorality of individuals had no connexion
with it; yet the people, not satisfied with this, were carried so far
by their fears, that they punished Oppia for an alleged violation
of chastity, under the impression that this might have contri-
buted to the anger of the gods, Such appears to be the force of
tamen. The punishment was, burying alive.

CHAP. ΧΙ,ΙΙΙ.-18 Vejentes aqrum quoque] Aldus was the
first to introduce this reading. The reading previously used was,
quentesquoque ayrum, which, in my opinion, is the more natural one.

¹⁹ Non sud sponte] “ Not of their own accord? but by the
agency of Licinius.

²⁰ Tota invidia tribuniciae potestatis] “All the odium, raised
against the tribunician power, was now directed against (Licinius)
the author of this turbulent opposition.”

²¹ Ducendus Fabio in AEquos, in Vejentes Furio, datur] This
reading, which was first established by Sigonius, on the authority
of one or two ancient copies, preserves a consistency in Livy's
statement3 for he says in the next chapter, Prooeimo bello, in ipsa·
acie, consensu exercitiis, traditam ultro victoriam victis AEquz's.
The old reading of almost all the MSS. and printed copies, viz.
Fabio in Vejentes, in AEquos Furio, datur, destroyed this con-
sistency.

²² Nec illos, etsi non adhortatio ducis, suum saltem flaqz‘tium...
coyere potnit] “ Nor, although the exhortation of their gene-
ral, whom they hated, had no effect on them, (which was not to be
wondered at) could their own infamy at least, (which might have
been expected) and the public disgrace at present, and danger
soon after, if the enemy would have rallied their courage, compel
them to accelerate their pace, or, if they did nothing else, even
stand in order of battle?

’Β Instare] This means “to stand in the same place 3⁹⁹ as im-
muuz're means ‘⁶ to fortify in the same place? Tac. An. 11. 19;
and incoemre, “to sup in the same places* Suet. Tib. 39-Mu-
retus and Crevier think the reading should be stare.
