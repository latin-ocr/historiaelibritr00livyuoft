δ’ Morte amitti melius ratum] “ That, having imagined it
better that his children should be lost by death than (115110110111,
119 had fallen, through compassion, into what wore the appear-
ance of cruelty.’ ⁹ Perhaps it would 119 better to make two sen-
tences of this by a period at liberos, and making ratum a verb.

⁶⁵ Mortem occubuisse] Occumbere, occumbere mortem, occum-
bere morti, and occumbere morte, are phrases indifferently used by
the best Latin authors to signify “to die.’'

⁶⁶ Profliqatam] “ Far advanced ;'’ ἰ. e. that the power of the
decemvirs was nearly destroyed at Rome. Profliyare sometimes
means “ to advance a thing far3 10 bring it nearly to an end ;’' 35

quoestio. Flor. primo commissum bellum, secundo profliqatum,
tertio vero confictum est.

⁶¹ Insecutique] “ And others having arrived there after
them, who said, &c.'’ This word and immixti above, which refer
to two classes of persons, are the subjects to perpulerunt.
Quum—simul here signify the same as quum—tum. Insecutos,
which is wrong, is the reading of some copies.

⁶⁸ Veneremque siqua] ‘⁶ To cry out, one and 311, 10 arms, and
pluck up their standards. ’² When a general, after having con-
sulted the auspices, determined to lead forth his troops to battle,
3 red flag (vexillum) was displayed on a spear from the top of
the general' s 19111, proetorium5 then having called them to
assembly by sound of trumpet (classico, 1. e. tuba concione advo-
cata) 119 harangued the soldiers, who answered by shouts of j0y,
or by beating on the shields with their spears. To this Milton
finely alludes B. 1.1. 669.

Hurling defiance toward the vault of heaven.''

After the harangue all the trumpets sounded (siqua canebant),
which was the signal for marching. At the same time the
soldiers eried out “ 10 arms” (ad arma conclamatum est), and the
standards, which during the encampment stood fixed in the
ground, were plucked up (siqua convellebantur). Siqnum was
the standard of the infantry, each manipulus having one3 vexillum
was 11131 of the cavalry.
