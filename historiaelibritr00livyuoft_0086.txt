68 NOTES To BOOK 1. c. 7, 8.

² Eximid] Like τέλειος in Greek-—noue but- the choicest
and best victims were sacrificed. Eximius, from eximo, “to take
out;’' for such only were taken out of the flock or herd for
sacrifice.

³ Potitiis] From potior, as they were in time enough to
“ enjoy’' the feast. Pinariis, from πεινάω, esurio, as they were
obliged to “fast” on account of their delay. So say the com-
mentators ; but it is a question whether it may not be inferred
from Livy, that they were so called before the event occurred.

⁴ Antistites.] These were the chief priests of the temple 3 from
ante and sto. It generally means a person superior in any thing.

⁵ Servis] Executioners, lictors, διο.

Cau». V111.--⁶ Jura dedit] See DionysiuS, B. 2.

⁷ Lictoribus] From liqo, “ to bind‚” because each carried an
axe “tied up” in a bmidle of rods, the iron being visible. Their
office was to disperse the multitude,to fiog, and to behead. Others
say the word is derived from their being appointed to bind the
hands and feet of criminals.

⁸ Et apparitores hoc glenus] For apparitorum hoc acum, 830.
which some would read ; so Cicero ad Attio. B. 13, orationes aut
aliquid id qenus scribere ; Varro, coramenta omne oenus—omne
yenus frumento pascuarum—It is an idiom common in Latin.
“ That both this sort of beadles‚ and the number also of them,
were borrowed from the Tuscans.'’ This is the reading and
explanation of Gronovius. The following would, says VValker,
be a bet-ter reading, quibus ut apparitores et hoc qenus ab Etruscis
—nzcmerum quoque ipsum ductum placet-—“ who are of opinion
that, as even this kind of public servants was derived from the
Etrurians, so was the number of them also.'' The former read-
ing waS, et apparitores et hoc qartus, which must be wrong, as it
would appear from it that the kings of Alba had no attendants,
until this kind was taken from the Etrurians3 but this was not
the case. Apparitores, from apparere, were public servants, that
always ‘'‘ appeared” with the magistrates, and attended to and
executed their orders.

The toqa was the characteristic dress of the Romans, as the
pallium was of the Greeks: it was a loose robe worn over the
tunica, the coat 01· jacket which had no sleeves: during war it
was exchanged for the paludamentum. Magistrates and the sons
of the nobility, until the age of seventeen, wore one that had a
fringe or border of purple all round, and this was called toqa
praetexta, or “ the bordered gown.’'

⁹ Sella curulis] This was an ivory seat, somewhat in the
form of the letter X, supported by four crooked legs, and car-
ried folded up in their chariots (hence curulis) originally by kings3
afterwards by consuls, dictators, censors, praetors, and chief aediles
(who were thence called curule aediles‚) and on which they sat in
the senate house, rostra, aud tribunal of justice.
