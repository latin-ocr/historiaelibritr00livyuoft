74 NOTES To BOOK 1. c. 13, 14.

the accession of Tatius’ men the number was considerably in-
creased, a new division was made, and names given to the tribes
anew.

emp XIV-⁵⁹ Jure qentium aqerent] They wanted to de-
mand that right, which the law of nations grants to the injured,
i. e. the right of address ; but Tatius was too partial to his people
to grant it, and therefore the vengeance, which was levelled
against them, he brought by his conduct upon himself.

'¹⁰ Infldam societatem-J Because partnership in sovereign power
is never kept up with fidelity or friendship. This seems to con-
tradict what was said at the close of the last ch. concors etiam
reqnum duobus reqibus fuit. The contradiction may be thus
explained :—Though there was apparent concord, yet there was
latent distrust3 or, though at first they agreed together, they
afterwards quarrelled.

⁷¹ Expiarentur leqatorum injuriae, ζα] As a league was always
struck with sacrifices and other rites of religion, it was consi-
dered necessary, whenever either party violated it by any outrage,
to expiate the crime by new sacrifices and new religious rites,
and go through the form of striking another league. Glareanus
asks how this guilt could be expiated by the simple renewal of a
league 3 and Sigonius sayS, that either there is some omission in
the text, as the ceremony of expiation‚ which Dionysius and
Plutarch mention, is not here described, or that the ceremony is
contained in the word foedus. But Gronovius well observes, that
Livy does not speak here of a “ religious'’ expiati0n‚ when atone-
ment was made to the godS‚ but of a “ civis’ expiation, (as there
were two kinds,) where atonement is made toinjured man. Both
parties here suffered injury from each other; this was mutually
redressed‚ and the ties of friendship renewed.

τι* Et cum hia] “ With these also,’' as well as with the
Sabines, “ there was an unexpected peace.”

⁷² Prope ειη] The commentators think these words should be
expunged.

⁷³ occupant bellum facere] “ They anticipate the Romans, and
are the first themselves to make war.''

⁷⁴ Vastatur aqri quod-est] “ All the territory that lies
between the city and F idenae is laid waste?

⁷⁵ Arcebat.] “Served as a barrier to the Romans against
them.''

⁷⁶ Mille passuum] Scil. ad mille passuum. Mille here is a
substantive governing passuum. Mille passuum, mille hominum,
and the like, are the same as mille passus, mille homines, διο.

⁷⁷ Locis circei densa ob sita virqulta obscuris] “ In the places
round about, which were dark on account of the thick brushwood
that grew there.'’—-Some connect circa with obscuris ; some with
eim—The general reading is, circa densa obsita virgulta, which
Crevier thus explains: “ among the thick shrubs that were planted
