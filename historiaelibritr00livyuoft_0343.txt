administration of justice, pure as if from an oracle 3 at the same
time their exertions were used in framing the laws.'’ Promptum,
“ready drawn‘⁴ as it were for the use of all.

⁵ Atque in medium] “ And bring to public discussion what-
ever may be superfluous or defective in each article.”

⁶ Quas consensus omnium] “Which the general consent might
appear not more to have ratified when proposed, than to have
itself proposed ;” consequently, these laws would be more ac-
ceptable to them, if they appeared in some measure to have
emanated from themselves.

'¹ Ad rumores.] “According to the reports of the people
'respecting each head of the lan-S, as it was published.” Editos,
agreeing with rumores, would appear a better reading.

⁸ cedentibus invicem] “ Because the decemvirs in turn
allowed an appeal, every one from his own decision to the other
deoemvirs.'’

CHAP. XXXV.-—⁹ In trinum nundinum] “For the third
market day following.” On every ninth day (nono die) there
was a public market in Rome, to which the country people and
citizens resorted to buy and seII, and see what laws, or other
public matters were proposed. Between every two market days
there intervened seven working days. Trinunclimcm was the
space of time, within which there were three market days, and
this was the space of seventeen days3 for, if the first mai-ket
day fell on the first of the month, the second would fau on the
ninth, and the third on the seventeenth3 because in counting
the nine days, the market days themselves were to be counted
inclusively. Notice, or proclamation (edictum), of every law or
other public matter, which was to be brought under the conside-
ration of the people, was posted up, or otherwise publicly given,
for three market days, that the people might be the better pre-
pared for it. Formerly these max-ket days were reckoned among
the fierioe ,· consequently no public assembly could be held on
them3 but by the Hortensian law they were reckoned among the
dies fasti, or days appointed for law business.

¹⁰ Impuqnatum] The patricians at first opposed the establish-
ment of the decemvirate.

¹¹ Demissa jam in discrimem] Appius was stimulated‚ when he
beheld men so advanced in age, and who had held such high
offices, “ thus lowering their dignity to the hazard of a contest’'
for this honour.--See ch. 28. n. 54. This is the explanation
given of the passage hythe commentators, but Ι think it may
be more simply rendered thus ε “ his dignity at his time of life,
after he had enj0yed such high honours, being now reduced to
jeopardy, excited Appius.” Appius feared that in the great
competition among the patricians for the office, he would be re-
jected, and thus was his dignity in danger of being humbled.
His being called the youngest of his colleagues ‘m no objection
