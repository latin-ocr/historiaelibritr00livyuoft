CHAP. XIV-²⁰ Pacatoe profectioni] “The custom handed
down from the ancients, (and, among other established usages,
it still continues even to the present time at every sale of public
property,) ‘of selling king Porsena's goods,' is inconsistent
with this peaceful departure of the Etrurian king from the
city.’' The public crier, before the sale began, repeated this
,form of words, which seem to breathe a hostile spirit, though
they did not, as appears from the king's peaceful departure,
originate from any hostile proceeding. Titulos is a “form of
words'' used to show or explain any thing, a title, an inscription ;
as titulus libri, sepulchri, imayinis, διας hence it often signifies
‘⁶ a sign or indication.'’

³⁰ Proximum vera] “ Of all the accounts that are given,
this seems nearest to the truth, that Porsena, &c.''

³¹ Venisse] “ Were sold,'' from veneo, ire, iti, um.

³⁸ In potestatem populi Romani esset] “ Which· was not even

the consuls of one year. According to Dionysius, M. Horatius
and P. Valerius were consuls, and after them Sp. Lartius and
Τ. Herminius.

²⁵ Non quim] “ It was not because this answer could not be
briefly returned, ‘that the king would not be received,' that a
select number of the patricians was for this purpose sent to
him, rather than this answer at once given to his ambas-
sadors at Rome 3 but '⁷

⁸⁷ Romani, misal] “And when the Romans should, unless
they wished to be accessary to their own destruction, give a
refusal to one, to whom they would wish to refuse nothing.''

³⁰ Non in reqno populum Romanum, sed in libertate, essa] The
obvious, and, I think, the most natural, meaning of the words is
this, “the Romans were no longer under the dominion of their
kings‚ but in the enjoyment of liberty,'' and that therefore they
were resolved to maintain that liberty, and have no more kings 3
but Walker says that Porsena already knew this, and that it was
unnecessary to tell him so. He says the clause is introduced
to give a reason for the preceding one, “ nisi inp. ⁸·f· e. v.,”
and that it means “ that the Roman people, under the govern-
ment of the kings, did not exist as a people,’' i. e. had no power
