NOTES TO BOOK Ι.

CHAP. 1.—²⁰ Soevitum esse] “ That cruelt y was practised towards
the other Trojans-that the Greeks refrained from exercising all
the right of war against two, AEneas and Antenor, both on
account of an old tie of hospitality, and because,’' &c. Most
MSS. and old editions read AEneoe Antenorique. “ J us belli,'’ in
