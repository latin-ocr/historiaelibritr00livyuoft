¹³ Ad illa m. pro se.] ‘⁶ Let every one, to the utmost of his
power, turn his thoughts to the following considerations :—What
the mode of life waS‚ and what the manners, of the people; by
what sort of men, and by what measures in peace and war, their
power was both established and extended ;” pro se is the same as
pro sud virili parte ; ‘f mihi” is often introduced superfluously.
¹⁴ Velut desidentes] A met-aphor borrowed from an old house
which at first gives way 01· yields a little, then sinks more and
more, until at last it tumbles headlong. Desidentes from
desido.
· ¹⁵ Nec vitia nec remedia] Neither the vices, says Walker, by
which the public liberty was lost, nor the absolute powers of the
Caesars, by which it was asserted that those vices would be
remedied. But I do not think Livy limits his views to that.
¹⁶ Omnis te exempli documenta] “ This is that which above all .

in case with the relative, and also put the relative in the same
case with the antecedent : this is called attraction by the gram-
marians.—See B. 2. c. 47.--and c. 3. n. 45, of this book.
¹⁸ Divitia: avaritiam] “Riches introduced avarice3 (i. e. a
thirst for riches) and abundant pleasures introduced a longing-
for pleasure, during a state of general luxury, and a blind love
of running headlong to destruction and destroying every thing
else.’' Such was the general corruption of the times, that even
in the midst of pleasures, men, from their great thirst for them,
neemed to want them. Desiderium is an uneasy longing after
· an absent· good. Others connect the words thus :--Desi-
derium pereundi· perdendique omnia, per luxum et libidinem.
