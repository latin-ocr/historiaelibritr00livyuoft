here, means “ obstinately and constantly to draw back from any

end of the sentence.

Shakspeare, “reproach and beggam* is crept into the palace of
our king.²’ Sometimes the verb is found to agree in number
with the remoter subJect, as Shakspeare, Midsummer-Night's
Dream.

‘¹ But all the story of the night told o’er
And aa their minds transfigured so together,
More witnesseth than fancy's images,
And grows to something of great constancy.”
