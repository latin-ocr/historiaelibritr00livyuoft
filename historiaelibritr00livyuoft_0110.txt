were unanimous. Crevier reads consensum. “ The war was
unanimously agreed on.” This phrase occurs B. 8. c. 6.

⁹⁴ Sanquineam] “Smeared with blood ;'' or “whose bark
was naturally of a blood-red colour.''

⁹⁸ Quod populi. . . ‚secer-unt] “ Because, or, for as much
as the Latius have acted, transgressed against, &c.''

Caii». ΧΧΧΙῙΙ.--96 Circa Palatium, sedem veterum Romam-
rum.] “And since the Sabines had taken up the capitol and
citadel, and the Albans, Mount Coelius, which were the places
situated round the Palatium, the seat of the original Romans-’⁹
Many old copies read veteres Romani.

⁹⁷ Aventinum ποτε multitudini datum] Aventinum is sometimes
used thus in the neuter gender, as after, and B. 3. c. 67,
adi-ersus nos Aventinum eapitur. Dionysius calls it frequently
eb ’Aginna-1262.

³⁸ Omni bello Latino Medulliam compulsa] “ The whole force
of the belligerent Latius being brought together to Medullia,
the contest was carried on there for some time with various suo-
cess, while the general issue of the war remained uncertain.''
Mars, iu Livy, when opposed to victoria, means the whole suc—
cess and termination of a campaign or battle; though each party
may at different times gain some advantage, yet the general issue
may be uncertain. Varid victorici ; aequo, or, incerto Marte,
are phrases often used by Livy. See B. 2. c. 16.

an incentive to lust. The myrtle was sacred to her, as it usually

Cinqi, or some such word, is understood to muro. This is a very

ommon kind of ellipsis, when only one verb is joined to many
substantives, while the verb, which properly agrees-with some of
them, is suppressed. Muro cannot depend on conjungi, as it is
not likely the Janiculum was joined to it at this time, as the
Piraeus was to Athens. See B. 3. c. 68. In Tiberim is another
reading3 both forms are used.

⁴ Sublicio.] “ Wooden,’' from sublicae, “pnes” driven into the
water to prop the bridge. See Caesar, Bell. Gall. B. 4. ς. 17.

” Haud parvum munimentum &planioribus aditu loc-ia] ‘⁴' No
trifling defence in places which were low in situation, or level of
approach.” Ab eci parte. says Rhenanus, quei erant loca planiora
