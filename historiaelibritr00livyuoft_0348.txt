——ch. 43, modo trzoums prohibentibus tribunos coire ad interreqem
prodeundum.

ω censendo enim] “ For by expressing such an opinion, tne
author of it judged that there were some magistrates who could
hold the senate 3⁹² whereas, the motion of Claudius went to show
the contrary.

Β Quonam fato incidisset] “Saying that he wondered by
what fatality it happened, that those who had been themselves

canvassing for the decemvirate, or their accomplices, or these,
(i. e. Horatius and Valerius,) particularly of their accomplices,
should now attack the decemvirs.’' This is the way in which
the passage is generally explained: some think, that aut socii
aut 1ιί maxime, means, “ either as accomplices, or as these persons
who were most active.'’ Crevier thinks we should read, aut
soli, aut Izi maa-ime, and thus explains the words, aut soli, aut prce
ceteris omnes. I think the present reading may be more ration-
ally explained thus: That the decemvirs should be attacked by
men, who had been themselves candidates for the office, or who
had been their former associates, or above all, by these, ἰ. e.
Valerius, Horatius, and others, who were most hostile to them.
Socii may mean either the former associates and friends of the
present decemvirs, or the associates and friends of men who had
once been decemvirs; if hi alludes to Horatius and Valet-itm,
the reason why he alludes to these seems to be, that as the
decemvirate was first established for the purpose of giving addi-
tional security to the liberties of the people, he thought it
surprising that that power should be assailed principally by those,
who pretended to be the great champions of those liberties. If
the text be incorrect, and that any emendation be introduced, Ι
think the most simple and rational one would be, the changing
of the second aut into ut, and making 1ιὶ maxime an emphatic
repetition of the two former classes of persons, ἰ. e. qui decem-
viratum petissent, and socii ,- Livy often uses such repetitions.—

e . . .
sew 0ἶὲιέαέ civitate] “ While the state was at ease ;” i. e. free

from foreign alarm.

'¹¹ Quid affatum] “ Their misehievous conduct.'’

⁷² Caeterum neminem . . . verum esse, praejudicium ...... afferre]
“ That it was not fair that any one should prejudge so important
a matter.”-See B. 2. c. 48. n. 78.--B. 5. c. 11.

⁷³ Se parare Ap. Claudium] Parare is coupled to aqi, and
depends on placere in the beginning of the sentence.

'⁴ Proeverti.] “Should be done first-’‘-See c. 22. n. 92.-
B. 2. c. 24. n. 15. This verb, as well as ducere and haberi,
depends on censere in the preceding sentence.
