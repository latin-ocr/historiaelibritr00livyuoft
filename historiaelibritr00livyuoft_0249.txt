izo-ms ‘ro noox 11. c. 61, 62. 231

⁶ Plenus suarum] Crevier thinks these words mean “the
resentment of the people against himself and his father 3⁹⁹ but
Walker says that, though ira rei alicujus generally means
“resentment on account of any thing‚” just as, in Livy, ira
uxoris corrupta> means “resentment on account of a wife being
debauched? and ira ereptae provinciae means “resentment on
account of a province being taken away 3³³ yet it is very ques-
tionable whether sua paternaque ira can mean “resentment
against himself and his father.” He says that plenus irae un-
doubtedly always means “ a person burning with rage,” not “ one
against whom the rage of another burns.’'—-See B. 6. c. 18.-
“ Β. 27. c. 40. Invisus here can be taken in an active sense to
mean “ one who hates, or is hostile to,” as B. 4. c. 53.-B. 5. c.
8. See c. 56. n. 69.

⁷ Non temera] Hardly ever, seldom3 perhaps, more literally,
‘³ did not, at all hazards‚ exert themselves as much for any one.’'

⁸ Oppositum] “Opposed as a sort of barrier.” Opponere
and objicere are often applied to barriers raised to prevent
inundations, &c-

⁹ Modum duntaxat ...... eqressum] “Who only out-
stepped the bounds of moderation a little.’'

¹⁰ Vestem mutaret] It was usual with persons under im-
peachment, and their relations and near friends, to go about in a
shabby garb, and also to let their beard and hair groxv, to show
their affliction‚ and excite pity.

²¹ Diem . . . prodicerent] “Prolonged the day of trial-”—
So B. 3. c. 57, and elsewhere. Most old copies read producerent.
So, for prodicta farther down, praedicta is sometimes read.

¹³ Trahi rem ...... ] “ The affair to be spun out, or die
away.” Walker thinks it means not so much what did actually
happen, as what the tribunes intended, or were going to allow·
I think it more natural to say, that they first put off the trial,
and then showed great carelessness and inactivity about bringing
it on at the appointed time 3 showed no disposition to agitate the
question any more. I think it refers to their acts rather than
their intentions.—See B. 3. c. 9. n.

¹³ Laudationem] “ The funeral oration.”—See e. 46. n.

CnAP. ΙΛΧΙᾙ-Η Reliyio fuerit] “ They felt religious
scruples.”-—See c. 5.

¹⁵ Vertit] Scil. sca—See c. 27.

¹⁸ Vicorum] Plutarch, in his Life of Romulus, says that the
Sabines, as being descended from the Lacedemom'ans, never
fortified their towns.

¹¹ Inteqro ...... bella] “ Though the war was not
finished.’' Res inteqra means “ a thing about which nothing has
been done ;” it is opposed to res peracta—See c. 5. Τ-Ιιθ consul
thought the retreat of the enemy was a proof of their defeat, and
so drew off his troops.
