Perque caput Remuli venit, et cava tempora ferro

Milton has instances of it, Thus speaking of Adam and Eve
Paradise Lost, B. 4. l. 720, he says :
Thus at their shady lodge arrived, both stood,
Both turn’d and under open sky ador’d
The God that made both sky, air, earth, and heaven,
Which they beheld, the moon’s resplendent globe,

And starry pole. ‘⁶ Thou also mad’st the night,
MaRer omnipotent, and thou the day, &c.''

Homer also gives instances of it.-—So, Il. B. 15. 1. 346,

figure called ἓν διὰ δυοῖν, which is employed by the best writers

supposing that figure here. Luxus may signify indulgence of
any kind and so differ from com-icium.
