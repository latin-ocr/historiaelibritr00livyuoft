’⁰ Volsci AEquine.] “ Whether it should be the Volsci or the
AEqui that would appoint a commander over their united army?

⁹¹ Fortuna populi] He elegantly represents the good fortune
of Rome as the agent of their destruction. Let not the young
reader imagine that the Romans attacked them.

⁹¹ Hernici provincia evenit-J “ The Hernici fell to Aquillius
as his province.” Many such phrases occm· in Livy.

⁹⁸ Cum Volscis oequo Marte discessum est] There is an
ellipsis here3 i. e. esz- praelio cum Volscis· This may be literally
translated thus, ‘⁶ they parted with the Volsci on even terms, or
with equal advantage on both sides.·”-—Dionysius (B. 8,) says
that Sicinius gained a signal victory over the Volsci3 that their
leader Attius Tullus fell in the battle3 and that Sicinius obtained
the honours of a triumph3 whereas Aquillius enjoyed only au
oration.

emp, XL1.—⁹⁴ Ayri duoe partes] “ Two thirds of the cap-
tured land were taken away ; the other third was given back to
the Hernici, which is a charge brought soon after by his col-
league against Cassius.

⁹⁵ Sed et publica Patribus] “ Apprehension for the publi«
safety also seized the fathers.”

⁹⁶ Fastidire munus vulqatum ὰ civibus isse in socios] ‘⁶ Who
felt disgusted that his gift should have gone from the citizens to
the allies, having thus become common and contemptible.”
Some editions for isse, read esse ; some, eyisse. Gronovius thinks
the word isse should be expunged. Walker proposes to read
the passage thus: fastidire munus vulqatum; ὰ civibus isse in
socios. Drakenborch thinks that sese should be read for esse,
i. e. ὰ civibus sese, “from themselves who were citizens.'’ He
says very truly, that there are numberless instances of this
transposition of letters.

⁹⁷ Quid . . . attinuisse reddi] “ What purpose could it serve
to restore, &c.” Atiinet often means “to contribute to a pur-
pose, to be necessary.'’—See B. 3. c. 36.

⁹⁸ Ambitiosus in socios] ‘⁴ Anxious to be popular with the allies.''

⁹⁹ Siculofrumento.] See ch. 34.

¹ Peculium] This properly means the private property,
which a slave possesses with the consent of his master3 and, as
a father at this time had the power of life and death over his
children, who were in a state of absolute slavery to him, their
propert-y was called peculium. But the word is often taken in a
wider sense to signify in general the property of a father of a
family. It may be observed that familia sometimes means one’s
whole property3 50, familia in an after passage must be used in
the same sense as peculium here.
