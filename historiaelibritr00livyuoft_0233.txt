Nom-:S To BOOK 11. c. 44, 45. 215

CHAP. Xle.-²⁴ Ti] This always stands for Tiberius.

¹⁵ Processisset] “ As if it had succeeded with? This word has
frequently this signification in Livy, and other authors. So Sall.
Jug. 35, parum procedere meanS, ‘⁵ to have little success.” Ge„
dere too is often used in the same sense.

²⁶ In proesentia re ipset] “For the present by the very act
(i. e. by the defeat of Licinius the year before) and to all future
times by the precedent which was thereby established? i. e. when
the patricians had once found that the tribunician power could be
defeated, they would always have recourse to the same method of
defeating it. Reipublicae is the reading of most old copies and
MSS. in place of re ipset.

²⁷ Bono publiea] “ By promoting the public good.’'

²⁸ Ut cuique privatim aliquid juris adversas sinyulos erat]
“According as each had in his persona] capacity any influence
with them individually.⁷’ Jus often signifies “ power or influ-
ence ;” and advers-118 does not always imply “ hostile opposition or
injury.” So Β. 5. c. 35, adversas Romanos nullum iis jus societatis

amieitiaeque erat ; see also Ter. And. 1. 1. 15.
²⁹ Quatuorque tribunorum] In the MSS. and old editions,

the reading was novemque tribunorum, which is quite incorrect, as
at this time there were only five tribunes. Sigonius has well
observed that the mistake arose from the inaccuracy of tran-
scribing IV, V being written X, as it often waS, through igno-
rance or carelessness.

³⁰ Id unum venenum] i. e. Internal dissension.

³¹ Sustentatum] ‘⁶ Retarded in its progress.”

³² sisti] See ch. 29. n. 52.

⁸³ Non parendi maqistratz'bus morem] “That the custom of
disobeying the magistrates, &c.”

³² Multis invicem casibus victos victoresque] “Who by many
vicissitudes were vanquished and victors by turns.'' Livy ap-
pears to mean, that they expected some decisive advantage now
from the divisions of the Romans, especially as they were some-
times successful against them, even when united.

CHAP. XLV-³⁵ Ne rem committerent e6.] “ Lest they should
bring the affair to a state of things where they would have two
armies to fear at the same time.’' i. e. their own and the enemy’s.

³⁶ Aversi] “Keeping aloof from.’'—So Hor. Sat. 2. 3. 107,
aversus mercaturis. Sometimes the preposition ὰ is expressed3
aS, Milites aversi ὰ praelia—Caes. Bell. Gall.

⁸⁷ Dies-tempus] See B. 1. c. 56. n. 45. Supply sperantes

or dicentes alius alii.
³⁸ Remedium timoris] “ An artifice to conceal their eowardice.”

This is the usual explanation of these words3 and it accords
with the context. But it is a question whether remedium can
be taken to signify “ a cloak‚ or stratagem of concealment;'' its
proper and ordinary meaning is “a remedy to cure any evil, ox
