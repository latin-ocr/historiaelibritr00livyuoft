aid the Sabines. The treaty which Romulus entered into with
the Vejentes, (see ch. 15,) had been violated.—-See ch. 27. It
appears that Tullus renewed it for a hundred years, on the eon·
clusion of the Fidenatian war. Perizonius, Animadver. Histor.
e. 4, says, we should read, in place of pacta cum Romulo, pacta
eum Tullo ; for Livy says, ch. 42, bellum cum Veientibus (jam
enim induciae exierant) sumptum, scil. ὰ Servio Tullia-He

δ” Novendiale sacrum] “ A festival of nine da55.” This was
of two kinds: one in honour of the dead on the ninth day aster
burial; the other (which is alluded to here) was held for nine
successive days, for the purpose of expiating a prodigy.
