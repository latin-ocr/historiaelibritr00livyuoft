given by the tribunes to the decrees of the senate. Appellatio
was an appeal from an inferior to a superior magistrate3 01· from

Β Libidinose . . .eonsulebatur.] ‘⁶ They behaved caprieiously.'’

Β Hominum, non causarum] “ They were altogether influ-
eneed by the rank of the parties concerned, and not the nature
of the ease.'’

³⁰ Judicia. . . conflabant] “ Made up their decisions.’' This
‘verb properly means ‘²‘ to cast metals ;’' hence it came metaphori-
cally to mean, “ to forge, to make up.”

³¹ Sine auctore] Without its be'ng known from what autho-
rity it emanated.

ἒ obtinerent] “Keep a lastirg hold of.” This verb is often
used in this sense.

CHAP. XXXV11.—⁸³ Unde] ί From whom 3⁹⁹ i. e. from the
patricians. The people were the cause of the appointment of
the decemvirs.

³⁴ Haud indiqnis] “ That these things happened to them

action of plundering. Ferre means “to carry off inanimate
things ;” aqere, ‘⁶ to lead or drive away animals.’'

here in the text. Drakenborch would propose this reading:
qaum fortuna, quei, quicquid cupitum, fieret, potentioris esset ,-
ἱ. e. “when Fortune, through whose means whatever was de-
sired was obtained, attended the more powe1·ful.'’ Fieret and
foret, it is true, are often confounded in MSS. Gronovius pro-

⁴¹ Viryis caedi] i. e. Alii virqis caedz'. There are very many
