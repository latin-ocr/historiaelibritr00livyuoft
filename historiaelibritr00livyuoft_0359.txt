Ζ g’ssfflrog'] ‘⁵ That they would then know that, without the

restoration of the tribunician office, matters could not be restored
to concord.’' Many interpreters think sciturosque, or qudm,
would be better, as the propriety of such expressions as scire
qued, dicere qued, respondere quod, and the like, is questionable.
Potestas is often applied to the office of the tribunes of the
people‚ and imperium always to that of the consuls, or other chief
magistrates.

⁸¹ Via Nomentum} . . . Ficulensi] This road was so called,
because it led to the towns Nomentum and Ficulea3 after the

⁸⁴ Toqatorum aliorumque] Crevier sayS‚ that que here, in*-
troduced first into the text by Sigonius, (whose readings are
often incorrect,) and adopted by succeeding editors, injures the
meaning of this passage.

they cannot bear its loss, especially when we do not, in the ex-
ercise of our power, behave with such moderation, as that they
may not stand in need of the assistance of the tribunes? Cre-
vier says, that ne here is the same as nedum.

against the animosity of the people.”-—-See c. 51. n. 73.—e. 55.

They say that the decemvirs, even though they may not be
punished', are abundantly humbled by having lost the power of
doing injury. Walker says, that satis superque mean sometimes
what is fully sufficient, not what is too much. ·As Hor. Epod. l.

thinks there is some mistake in the sentence.
