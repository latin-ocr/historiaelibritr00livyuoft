vens or earth marked out, in order to take an augury, by the
augur uttering a certain form of words :⁹⁹ hence contemplor. Ad
inauyurandum, “ to take the omen.'’ Sometimes the verb means
“ to consecrate a place or person‚” as in B. 3. ch. 20. Templa,
“ consecrated stands.”

⁸⁹ Tempore illi praecepta] Remus and his followers claimed
the sovereign power from priority of time in seeing the birds;
Romulus, from his having seen twice as many as Remus.

⁸⁰ Sic deinde] “ So perish hereafter, whoever else, &c.”

CnAP. V11.-⁹¹ Condita urbs] Rome was built, according to
Cato’s calculation, on the llth before the Calends of May, (i. e.
the 2lst of April) the festival of ¹Pales, in the lst year of the 7th

nc. 753. Dodwell endeavours to show that Livy followed Cato.

’Β Graeco, Hercula] i. e. Graeco ritu. Most old copies have
Graeco Herculi, improperly connecting these words,

⁹⁸ Aversos] “ With their faces turned off in a direction oppo-
site to the cave.” Avertere, in a former clause, has not this force 3
it merely means “ to turn off‚’' or “ drive away.''

⁹⁴ Aqere porra] “ To drive on.'’ Infestus is applied to what-
ever brings evil on another.

meaning.—See Ter. And. 3. 4. 43.

that his unstained character and noble qualities gave him, than by
any absolute power he had as king.''

⁹⁷ Litterarum] The introduction of letters, which to the unci-
vilized inhabitants was quite a new thing, procured for him great
reverence from their surprising novelty. Literarum here means
the alphabet. Tacitus, An. 11. 14, states the same fact.

⁹⁸ Carmentae] She was also called Nicostrata.

⁹⁹ Olim] “ A nation that will hereafter be the most powerful
on earth.’' Olim has sometimes this meaning.—See AEn. 1. 293.

¹ Accipere se omen, impleturumque fata, ανᾶ condita* atque
dicata, ait] “ Says that he accepts the prophetie intimation‚
and will fulfil the fates, (i. e. those fates, which Evander’s
mother said ordained that he should be worshipped,) by building-
and dedicating an altar ;'' i. e. an altar to himself—See B. 9.
c. 34. Some would connect arci condite} atque dicata (making the
act Evander’s) with the following words, and place ait after fata,
or expunge it, for which some MSS. give authority. Dionysius,
B. 2, sayS, that Hercules erected an altar and sacrificed an ox
to Jupiter Inventor, on account, I suppose, of having· “found''
his cattle3 and then that Evander, on account of the prediction
of his mother, erected another, called maxima, to himself, and
likewise sacrificed an ox3 and that Hercules also offered on it
some oxen, and the tithe of his other spoil.
