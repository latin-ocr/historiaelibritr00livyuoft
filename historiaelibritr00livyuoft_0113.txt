NOTES To BOOK 1. c. 36, 37, 38. 95

⁸⁰ Comitia] A part of the forum, where in early times the
assemblies of the people, called comitia, convened for public
purposes, were held. After the people assembled in the Campus
Martius, the assemblies of the euriae were still held here. It

³¹ Certa] This is opposed to memorant before. Whether the
story about the whetstone be true or false, this is certain, &a

³² Summa rerum dirimerentur] “The most important con-
cerns of the state were put off.'’ Gronovius would read, exereitus
vocati de summa rerum.

⁸² Alterum tant-um] “ As many more.” Like τοσοῦτος ἕτερος.
‘Numerum is understood. So B. 8. c. 8.-B. 10. c. 46.-B. 45.
c. 10.

³⁴ Posteriores] These, who were added, were called Juniors,
but under the same name as they had before, i. e. Ramnenses
posteriores, Luceres posteriores, Tatienses poster-tores. Crevier
and others connect modo with posteriores appellati sunt ,· thus
“ they were only distinguished by the name of ‘ juniors’ prefixed
to their original name.'' For mille et octinqenti, some read mille
et ducenti ,· some, mille et treeenti--The commentators are diffuse,
and indeed not very clear, each in support of his favourite read-
ing—Drakenborch supports the present reading thus t—Romulus
had three centuries of horse, or 3003 Tatius added as many
more3 Tullus (ch. 30‚) added ten turms, i. e. 300, makingin all
900 horse—So that when Tarquin doubled the number in his
time, there were moa—But, as Walker observes, be the number
what it may, Livy says that Tarquin only doubled it.

³⁵ Geminatae sunt] i. e. by Serv. Tullius, See ch. 43.--Sex
centurias, “ the six centuries,'' by way of pre-eminence.

emp, ΧΧΧἛΤΙΙ.--36 Pleraque in ratibus] “ And when most
of it, driven against the piles, stuck in the timber of which the
bridge was made.'' Gronovius, Drakenborch, and Crevier
read, et pleraque ratibus impacta sublicisque cum mererent.
Others say that in ratibus means “placed on rafts.’'

²⁷ Pontem] A bridge which the Sabines built over the Anio.

’Β Et fusis.] The common reading, effusis, is manifestly in-
correct. Effundo, effluo, effrinqo, est-promo, and the like, are
often corruptly introduced into MSS. for et fundO, et fluo, et
ίγξθπᾳὲξιηξνῇἶῃέἕέΐοῖἳὲπῖἓσὲνξῗ “ Made the victory known.'’

⁴⁰ Tenuere] “Reached them.“ So portum tenere.

⁴¹ Vulcano] As it was by his agency the bridge was con-
sumed.

Onu». XXXV111.-⁴³ Collatia] Hence, says Dionysius, he
and his posterity were called Collatini ς for cirea some read citra.

⁴⁸ In sua potestate] “ At their own disposal.''

⁴⁴ Utensilia] This means generally any thing for use3 in
Tacitus the word means “ provisions.”
