nores 'ro BOOK 11. c. ll, 12. 189

² Secundum lapidem Gabinii vici] “At the two-mile stone
on the road to Gabii.''

⁸ Naevia] This gate was between the Tiburtian and Esquilian

ates.
g ⁴ Educz‘t.] Leads out from Mount Coelius, i. e. through the
gate called Coelimontana, which was between the Porta Naevia
and the Porta Collina3 so that when the enemy passed out
through the Porta Collina, they were hemmed round on every
side.

⁵ Concurrit] Rushes from his ambush on the enemy. Cre-
'vier says consur-qia& is more correct.

emp, ΧΙΙ.-“ἲ Servientem, quum sub reqibus esset] “ Even
when in a state of slavery, while they were under their kings.'’

'¹ Itaque] “ And so (as I intended to state) Mucius resolved.”
The discourse was suspended, while Livy stated 'Mucius’ reflec-
tions, and now he resumes the thread of the story, and returns,
as it were, to state his determination. Itaque here has the same
force as ἀρὰ often has in Homer. Crevier explains it by
“ therefore.’'

⁸ Fortuna tum urbis crimen affirmante] “ As the forlorn
=state of the city at this time would stamp eredibility on the
&argess' So B. 32, c. 35, opinionem affirmare, “ to confirm the
opinion.”

⁹ anorando reqem] “By showing his ignorance of the
king.” So Ter. Andr. ProL, πω faciunt intelliqendo ut nihil
intelli ant.

¹⁰ ὅτιὸ temere traxit fortuna facinus] “To whom (i. e. the
secretam) chance blindly directed the stroke.’'

¹¹ Destitutus.] “ Placed.” The word properly means to fix
down or station-See B. 23. c. 10.

¹² Fortia] With bravery. Iu Greek and Latin the neuter
of adJectives, particularly in the plural, is often used adverbially.

¹³ Capite dimices] “ That you may be in danger of losing
your life-’'—See B. 3. ch. 44, at the end. Duker and Crevier
think de should be used before capite ; but the verb is sometimes
found without the preposition. Verbs, compounded with pre-
positions, are used, as has been before shown, with or without
the repetition of such prepositions.

¹⁴ Uni tibi, et cum sinqulis, res erit] “ You alone must decide
the affair with us, aye, and with us one by one.'' Such is the
force of et singulis ,· the words represent the perpetual danger
the king would be in, as he would always have a new enemy to
encounter in each person.

¹⁵ Circumdari iynes.] “Fires to be kindled round him.’'—
See B. 3. c. 26, 28.

¹⁸ Gloriam vident] “ Who have great glory in view.’' There
are many instances of video in this sense3 petunt is another
reading.
