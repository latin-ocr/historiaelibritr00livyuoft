line. Now this distribution by districts or tribes, which were
merely certain portions of ground with the inhabitants, had
nothing to do with the centuries. But afterwards the tribes
became not portions of the city or country, but of the state 3 i. e.
they were a sort of fraternity of citizens, connected by a par-
ticipation in the common rights of the tribe, without any refe-
rence to their places of residence3 (see B. 3. ch. 51. n.) and
the centuries were included among them. Therefore, as the
number of tribes increased, so did the number of centuries‚ but
not the number of centuries in the several classes, according to
the original proportion under the system of Servius3 for if so,
the superiority of the first class would still continue. And the
consequence of this waS, according to Dionysius, that the in-
fluence of the lower orders in political matters became predomi-
nant, as their centuries out-numbered, and out-voted those of
the first class. He appointed country tribes or districts also3
their number seems to have been about fifteen or sixteen—See
B. 2, c. 21. These country tribes were considered more honour-
able than the city tribes, because the employment of agriculture
was held in the highest estimation, and because freedmen, me·
chanics, people in every kind of trade, and all the lowest of the
community, were-enrolled in the latter 3 so that when the number
of tribes increased to thirty-five, it was about double what it was
in the reign of Servius Tullius.

¹² Tributo] Others think the word comes from tres, because
there were three tribes first appointed by Romulus3 but Livy
calls these ‘'‘ centuries of horse,” and they differed totally not
only in name but in nature too from the tribes of Servius, be-
cause they only regarded the stock or origin of the constituent
members.

of contributing this too in even proportion, according to every
one’s property, was established by him.

CHAP. XLIV. -Η Quem maturaverat metu leqis de incensis
latae.] “ Which he had brought to a speedy close by means of
the dread of the law that was passed about those who were not
registered.”—It was this dread of the law that made them re-
gister so soon.—Doujatius would read metus, which would
certainly make the passage piamen—Deinceps was the common
reading of the old copies for de incensis.

¹⁵ Campo Martia] This is a figure called prolepsis, or anti-
cipation, as the place did not get this name until afterwards.—
See B. 2. c. 5.

¹⁶ Suovetaurilibus] A ceremony of purification, from sus,
ovis, and taurus, “a swine, a sheep, and a bull,'’ properly “a
boar, a ram, and a bull,'’ which, after being three times led round
the army, were sacrificed to Mars.
