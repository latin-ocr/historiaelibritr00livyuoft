divided by Romulus, had a priest to officiate for them, called
eurio; and the curio maximus, who was elected at the comitia
curiata, presided over them.

CHAP. V111.-⁴⁹ Inter-regma] See B. 1. c. 17, for the origin
of this3 the name and office lasted even after the expulsion oe
the kings. Whenever there happened to be no curule magis-
trate, the patricians met, coiere, and appointed an interrex, whose
