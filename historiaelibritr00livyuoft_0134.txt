things suggested, though not easy to be related by. writers, he
worked on the inflamed multitude so far, that they deprived the
king of his power.'’ Livy says that there were other atrocities
stated by Brutus and believed by the people, which the histo-

at such a distance of time, sufficient information about them.
Gebhardus, ou the authority of some MSS„ would read subjecit.
This, in my opinion, is a better reading than subjicit.

⁸² Ut imperivm reqi abroqaret] Roqo signified, to ask of the
people, in the usual form (jubeatis velitisque, Quirites) at the
public assembly, according to the object fo, which it may be
convened, to enact some law, elect a magistrate, ὅτε. Abroyo,
was properly “ to ask the people to annul some decision of theirs ;”
it mostly signified “to ask for the annulling of some law ;”
hence it comes to signify (generally) “to annul,“ to take away.
Arroqo, was properly “to ask for some addition to a law.” Deroqo,
“to ask that some part of a law may be annulled.” Subroqo, ‘⁶ to
ask that a part of a law may be substituted for another.” It
was mostly used to signify, “ to ask for the substitution of one
magistrate for another.’' Suyqerere or sufficere meant the “ act”
of substituting such magistrate. These words are taken in a
general sense to refer to other things. See Baxter's Reliquiae.

⁸³ Proefecto.] This was an extraordinary magistrate appointed
to govern the city in the absence of the king, and afterwards of
the consuls. This office lasted until the appointment of praetor53
and, after that time, the Proetor Urbanus, in the absence of the
consuls, discharged their dutieS, except when they went to the
Alban Hill on the “ Latin holidays;’' and, on this occasion, the
proesectus urbis was ¹still appointed, merely to keep up the old
form, and without possessing any substantia] power.—See Tacit.
Ann. 6. 11.

⁸¹ Furias] “ The furies that avenge the injuries offered by
children to their parents.’' These were a little before called
parentum πίστει-δερ also c. 48.

CHAP. Lx.-³⁵ Exsilium indictum] “ A proclamation of
banjshment issued against him.” This year was also famous for
the expulsion of the Pisistratidoe from Athens.

⁸⁶ Sem. Tarquinius Gabios tanquam in reqnum suum profectus]
Dionysius says that he was made king of Gabii by his father.

⁸⁷ A proefi‘cto urbis ez commentariis] This means that the
plan of the consular government was found in the commentaries
of the king, and had been drawn out, when he intended to resign
his power 3—see ch. 48, at the end3 or that the form of electioris
at the comitia centuriata was according to the plan he estab-
lished 3—see ch. 433 or it may signify bot-h. Dionysius (B. 4.
p. 269,) sayS, that the comitia were held by Lueretius not as
praefect of the city, but as interrex.
