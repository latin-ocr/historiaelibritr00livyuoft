322 Nori-cs 'ro BOOK 111. c. 29, 36.

⁰² Consularem animum] “A spirit worthy of a consul 3³⁹ foi·
this disgrace of the army proceeded from his timidity.-See ch. 26.

⁶³ Libram ponda] “ A pound in weight.'’ Pondo is the abla-
tive of the obsolete word pondus ,· the phrase is emptical, which is
thus explained: coronam habentem pondus libram pondo. Pondo
is often used without libra, as, decem pondo auri, scil. decem
librae pondo auri.

θ’ Quo veniebat aymine] “ In the same line of march with
which he came ;” for it was usual for the general to wait outside
the city, until the senate decreed that he should enter in triumph.

⁶⁵ Epuzantesque] “ And, partaking of the feast, while they
sung the triumphal hymn, (see Hor. B. 4. Od. 2.) and threw out
the customary jests, they followed the chariot after the manner
of revellet-s ;'' they used to amuse themselves sometimes with the
general, sometimes with the captives, or with one another. See
B. 4. c, 53. See Milton, Par. Lost, B. 6. 882, &c.—Sueton.

⁶³ L. Mamilia] See ch. 18.

θ’ Ad vastatos ayma] “ This calamity too fell on the Sabines
in addition to the devastation of their tenitories.”-This devas-

B. 3. c. 62, beginning.-B. 23. c. 38.

‘³⁸ Prodiqium] It was an extraordinary thing to see the wild
carnivorous heasts of the forest come into the very heart of
the cit -.

⁷⁰ Ni, velut dedita oper-11⁴] “ Had it not been announced, as
if intentionally, that, by a nocturnal attack of the AEqui, the
gart-ison at Corbio was cut off.”

⁷¹ Virwebaturqne] “ The consular authority was on the
point of being defeated by the tribunician aid.” Mark the
propriety of the epithets; the consular power was called im-
perium, which properly meant “military command‚'' as the consuls,
and military tribunes with consular power, had the command of
the army3 that of the tribunes, auxilii latio, or aua-ilium, (see
B. 2. c. 33. 55.) as they were intended to be merely the sup-
porters or protectors of the commons against the aristocracy.

⁷² Decem deinde tribunt] This measure weakened the in-
fluence of the tribunes, because then the senate could more
easily find out of ten thau out of five, one to lend himself to them
