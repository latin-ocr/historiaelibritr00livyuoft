186 Noa-ns To Boot< 11. c. 7, 8.

by Crevier and others a better reading3 as Valerius was annoyed
by two reflections—first, by the danger of incurring· popular
odium, and secondly, by the heinousness of the charge.

θ’ Summissis fascibus.] The fasces being lowered, (in token
of respect to the people,) being made to bow as it were before
the majesty of the people. Dionysius says the axes were taken
out of the fasces, and were never after carried in them before
the consuls inside the city ; this was to show that, at least within
the city, they could not behemi, and could only flog.

⁸⁸ Ad Aquillios se Vitelliosque recidisse] That he had fallen
back to a level with the Aquillii and the Vitellii in their estima-
tion, from being thought the liberator of his country.

⁶⁹ Si in ipsa arce Capitolioque habitarem] Crevier says that,
properly speaking, these were different parts of the same hill,
but which of them contained the temple of Jupiter is doubtful,
though the greater probability is, that it was the part called the
capitol. But I think arx here is not a part, but the whole
mountain, called arx Tarpeia, (of which rupes Tarpeia was a
pam) and formerly mons Saturnius, from a town built there by
Janus and called Saturnia, to commemorate his alliance with
Saturn, and that the capitolium was properly the fortress or
citadel (of which the temple formed a part) built on it, though
the name capitolium was sometimes given to the whole hill. In
this Ι am supported by the authority of Milton, Paradise Re-
gained, B. 4, 1. 43,-

Great and glorious Rome, queen of the earth,
So far renown’d, and with the spoils enrich’d
Of nations ; there the capitol thou seoet
Above the rest lifting his stately head

On the Tarpeian rock, her citadel
Impregnable.

 

So Virgi1‚ B. 8, 1. 652, describing the shield of AEneaS,

In summo custos Tarpeiae Manlius arcis
Stabat pro templo, et capitolia celsa tenebat.

Livy often uses these words together.—See B. 5, e. 39, 40, 41,
et alibi5 see also B. 1, c. 55.

'¹⁰ Memento] The MSS. reading is, tam levi momentaneoque
apud vos-fama pendere. But momentaneus is not considered pure
Latin. The meaning of the present reading is, has my charac-
ter such little weight with you ?—See B. 1. c. 47. n. 51.

⁷¹ Vicoepotae.] “ Where now the temple of victory is ;'' so
called from vinco and potior ‚· aedes is understood—See B. 3. e.
48. n. This word has been miserably mutilated in most
MSS·

Onu. V111.-⁷² Ver-terent] Rem, or some such word, is
understood.

²³ Popularem] “ Popular.'’ Popularis was used to signify
