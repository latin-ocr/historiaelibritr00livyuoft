AEncas’ colony would soon destroy his own and all the neighbour-
ing states, accolis.

⁸⁷ Sub eodem jura] “ That they should not only have the
same laws, but also the same name.”

³⁸ Moenibus] “He might, by remaining within his strong
wans, bid defiance to the enemy.’'

³⁹ Secundum inde praelium] Crevier sayS, that secundum is
“the second,'’ and that ultimum is opposed to it. But Walker says,
that this is contrary to the truth of history, as this was really the
first battle between the Trojans and Laurentines‚ now incorpo-
rated under one common name of Latius. He explains the pas-
sage thus :-—“ From this, i. e. from his having marched out his
forces, there ensued a battle successful to the Latius, but one 'm
which AEneas lost his life.’' So Tacitus, Hist. 4. 79, secundum
proelium fecit.

⁴⁰ Situs est] “Was buried.” Hence those who sung over
the dead, were called Silicines.

⁴¹ Quemcunque eum dici jus fasque θεέ] “Sive virum, sive
heroa, sive deum .· reliyionem vulqarem leviter perstringit Livius,”
says Walker. But others think that this is straining the obvious
and natural meaning of the passage, which appears to be:—
“By whatever epithet the “human law''(jus) and the “divine law”
(fas) require hfin to be designated.'’ According to the reli-
gion of the Romans, a mortai, raised after death to the rank of a
divinity, according to his various attributes and fonctions, had
many names, each of which, at certain times, according to cir-

ance with the national custom or prejudice‚ observes this reli-
gious cantion, when speaking for himself ; but gives the name
which he was commonly called by, Jovem Indiqez‘em.

⁴⁴³ Super Numicium flumen] “Above.’¹ “On an eminence
over the river N umicius.'’

⁴⁸ Indigetem] “ Terrestrial or canonized Jove.'' Dionysius
calls him χθὸνιον Θεὸν.

CHAP. 111.-⁴⁴ Tantisper tutela muliebri] “So long, under
the guardianship of a woman, (so great was Lavinia's talent,)
did the Latin state, and the kingdom of his father and grand-
father, continue secure for him :''-z'. e. so long did the people
remain firm in their allegiance.

⁴⁵ Haud nihil ambiqam—hz'ccine fuerit Ascanius] “I have
some doubts whether it was this Ascanius who succeeded his
father, or one older than he, who was born of Creiisa, while
Troy flourished, and then attended his father in his exile ;
the same, whom, under the name of Iulus, the Julian
family represent as their founder.” Another account of
this matter is, that Ascanius, the son by Creiisa, was the
father of Iulus, though Virgil makes them the same; and that
the son by Lavinia was Sylvius (from Sylva) ; because his
