No‘rns ‘ro Boon 11. c. 56, 57. 227

'¹' Non populi, ced plebis] Populus means the whole pe0p1e‚
including patricians and plebeians3 plebs, the plebeians only.—
See ch. 35.—B. 3. c. 19.

'¹⁸ Facile et contemptim] “ By arginng lightly and contemptu-
ously about his authority.” Drakenborch would rather reJeot
et, and join facile in the explanation of the passage to perturbare
or poterat.

⁷⁹ Sine imperio, sine Μαρίαν-πω] “Without military autho-
rity, without civil office.” This is the proper signification of these
words. Imperium sometimes means “ civil power,’' “ the right of
taking auspices,” and “ the power ordispensing justice? Let the

’ reader mark, that Livy here speaks in the person of Appius, who

denies the tribunes were “regular” magistrates, as being their
enemy. But Livy in this chapter, speaking as a histor-ian, calls
them maqistratus.—(See also ch. 33, 35.-.B. 4. c. 2.—B. 23.
c. 23.—B. 39. c. 52.) So t-he Latin histor-iaus call them. All
the Greek historians call them ἄρχοντες. They did not wear the
same badges of office, namely, the praetezta, &a as the other magis-
trates; nor, like them, did they enter on their office at the begin-
ning of the year; nor administer justice, sitting on a regular chair-
or bench; nor cease from their functions during a dictatorship3
besides, they were properly magistratus plebis, not maqistratus
populi. It is Ι think from these considerations that Appius
speaks.

CHAP. LVII. ——⁸⁰ Ab impetu ad consult andum advocabantur

. . . animi] ‘The more their minds were called off
from violence to cool deliberation, some time having intervened,
the more did they shrink (or were abhorrent) from conten-
tion.’' One MS. has avocabantur, which, says Drakenborch,
(and very justly,) is the word often used elsewhere in such circum-
stances. These words, like advertere and averrere, are often
confounded.—See Β. 1. e. 40. n. 67·--.eh. 6. n. 81.

⁸¹ Tantam] “ Only so great ;’' i. e. not to carry it so far as
to breed discord.

⁸¹ Dum tribuni consulesque ad se quisque omnia trahunt, nilzil
relictum esse virium in media] So, Sall. Jug. c. 41, coepere
nobilitas diqnitatem, populus libertatem, in lubidinem vertere ‚· sibi
quisque ducere, trahere, rapere. Ita onmia in duas partes ab·
:tracta sunt ; respublica, quae media fiterat, dilacerata.

Β Distractam.] The accus. for the nom. by Enallage, say the
commentators. There are many instances of such peculiarities
of phrase—B. 31. c. 27. Hic metus Codrionem oppidum ut
dederetur Romanis ‹fficit-—Virg- AEn. 1. 5733 urbem, quam
statuo, vestra est ;—Ter. Adelph. 5. 4, illum ut vivat optant.—
Eun. 4. 3. 11; eunuchum, quem dedisti nobis, quas turbas dedit.
Ι think such accusatives may be governed by secundum, or
some such preposition understood3 such an idiom is very
common in Greek, and has been adopted into the English
