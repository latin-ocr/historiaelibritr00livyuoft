ὅ* Qui credituros eos non vana ...... afferri] “ How could
they (the Tarquins) otherwise believe that false representations
were not made to them.’' The different readings of this passage

³⁵ Quum pridie] Walker says that Crevier and others reject

the et before coenatum3 but he says the common reading can be
thus explained, quum pridie (esset) ejus diei quo leqati ad Tar-
quinios proficiscerentur et coenatum esset. This, however, is
rather forced. Ifthe clauses et coenatum . . . esset, and conjurati-
que ...... eqissent, From the supposed impropriety of making
que follow et, be thought not to be good Latin, and not corres-
pond one with another, as I think they do, and that any change
be made, I think et conjurati ibi would be the simplest 3 et, as
being only a repetition of the last syllable of esset, may have been
easily omitted by transcribers through ignorance or carelessness,
and que introduced to complete the sentence. However this
is only a conjecture ε indeed it is not clear to me whether
et ...... que may not be used as et . . . . . . et ,· nothing is more
common in the classics than such variation of phrase.

³⁵ commisisse] “ Though they seemed to furnish grounds for
being considered in the light of enemies, yet the law of nations

³⁹ Contacta reqict praeda] “ Touched or infected with t=he
king’s plunder.'' Polluted, as it were, and rendered criminal in
the eyes of the king by their plundering his property. Contacta
is often used in this sense. B. 31. c. 8, multis in Italia con-
tactis qentibus Punici belli societates-And B. 38. e. 55, ut
omnia contacta societate peculatfts viderentur.—B. 4. c. 9, velut
contacta civitate rabie duorum juvenum-c. 15, bonaque contacta
’ crenis requi mercandi publicarentur Contracta and contrectata
