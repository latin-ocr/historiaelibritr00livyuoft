instituted by Numa, who were different from these, were called
Palatini, because they performed their ceremonies, and had their
chapel on the Palatine Hill.—See Crevier. Servius thinks, AEn.
8. v. 285, that both the Salii and the temples were vowed to
Paleness and Terror, and that these Salii were called Pallor-ii
and Pavorii. Others say the “shrines” only were offered to them.

²⁵ Idem imperat] Scil. rex imperat. “ He also commands
this horseman to bid the cavalry raise their spears.'' Eidem
(scil. equiti) would perhaps be a better reading, which Gronovius
and others mention.

²⁵ Et audiverant] “ The Fidenatians both heard what was
thus spoken in a lond voice, and many of them understood Latin,
as they were intermixed with Romans in the colony.’' When a
Roman colony had been planted in their town, they formed a.
part of it. The commentators imagine the passage to be faulty.
Faber corrects it thus: Ut queis coloni additi Romam· essent.
DouJatius, thus: ut qui coloni additi ὲ Romanis essent. But
the following passages justify, says Gronovius, the present read-
ing, B. 3, o. 1, (talking of the colony to be sent to Antium)
ade& pauci nomina dedere, ut ad erplendzzm numerum colom·
Volsci adderentur.—B. 8, c. 14, Antium nova colonia missa cum
eo, ut Antiatibus permitteretur, si et ipsi adscribi colom· vellent.

²⁷ Ab effusci fuya] It may appear to a tyro that there is a
contradiction here. It is said that the river behind them, which
lay in their way, prevented them from flying3 and in the next
sentence, that their fiight took a direction towards it. But Livy
only says,that it prevented them from flying in “ disorder,” ab effusd
fizqd ; it was so close to them that they had not time to scatter.

’Β Inter consilium] “While wavering between the resolution
whether they should fight or fly.''

cuir. ΧΧῩΙΙΙ.---”θ Quod bene vertat] A usual form of
words adopted in praying for success.

³⁰ Sacrificium lustrale] “A purificatory sacrifice,²’ the same
probably as suovetaurilia—See ch. 44.

³¹ Not-itate etiam] Not only induced by the command, but
also excited by the novelty of such a circumstance, as hearing a
Roman king deliver a speech.

³² Ea: composita] “ According to previous arrangement, the
Roman forces under arms are drawn round the AlbausJ' Ro-
mana leqio, the Roman army3 so last ch. leqionem Fidenatium.

⁹⁸ Si unquam ante αῑὶᾶε in ullo bella] “ If there was ever at
any time before in any war, Ο Romans 1 a reason that you should

return thanks, first to the gods, and next to your own valour, it ·

was yesterday’s battle.''

³⁴ Si ᾳαὸ eqo inde aqmcn] “ 11⁰ 1 wished to draw off my army
to any direction from that ground. ’³

⁸⁵ Quod bonum faustum filia-que sia] See ch. 17, n. 14.
