CHAP. xxxlx-⁵⁴ Obnoxia] With timid submission to the
decemvirs. ’

⁵⁵ Relationem] Referre is the word used to signify‚ “to lay
before another, or an assembly, the subject of debate.'' In the
senate, or assemblies of the people, it was done by the presiding
magistrate.

⁵⁶ De republica] “Concerning the state of the common-
wealth.'’ This was out of order, as the senate was convened to
consider about war.

⁵⁷ Horatiis] Dionysius says that it was Horatius induced the
army to revolt from Tarquin at Ardea3 and that Porsena in his
consulship was obliged to raise the siege.

Β Nec nominis] “It was not the mere ‘name' of king men
were then disgusted with.’'

⁵⁹ Sacris] See B. 2. c. 2. n. 14.

⁶⁰ In reqe tum eodem] “ In that same king, or in the king’s
son;” i. e. in Tarquin or in his son Sextus. Crevier thinks
the reading should be in reye tum eodem et filio reqis5 i. e.
in a man who was both king and the son of a king together.
Walker thinks eodem is opposed to tot in the following sense:
As the people at that time would not allow aking, who was
orne and the same individuaI, to commit so many enormities, it
is not to be supposed they will tamely endure them now from so
many, and these, private persons.

⁶¹ Quanto ferocior dolor.] “How much more forcible would
resentment prove to the people in preserving their liberty,
than ambition would to the decemvirs in preserving their unjust
dominion.’' Ferox often signifies merely ‘⁶ violent, vigorous,
strong 3³³ so does improbus ,· as, improbus amor, improbus labor,
improbus lapis.-Virg. Sometimes it signifies a savage joy.—
See B. 1. c. 58.

ω Graviora, quoe patiantur] He means that the people felt
more sensibly the weight of their present oppression, than their
apprehension of the danger of attempting to shake it off.

cair. ΧΙ,.--63 Nec ἱνα» nec iynoseendz'ff “When the decem-
virs could not discover the proper measure for their resentment
orforgiveness, (i. e. how far they ought to carry either,) or judge
how the business would end.''

⁶⁴ Precibus, qadim] i. e. Precibus maffia· quam ,· the ellipsis of
maqis in Latin, as of μᾶλλον in Greek, is very common.

⁶⁵ Claudium interpellandi] “ They felt a reverential disin-
clination to interrupt Claudius.” ⁷

⁶⁵ Sententiam iqitur pereqit] “Therefore he went through
with his resolution, that it was their opinion that no decree of
the senate was to be passed ;'' that, as the senate was not
convened by proper authority, they could pass no resolution.

θ’ Coire.] “ To meet.'’ Livy uses this word in this particular
sense elsewhere—B. 4. c. 7, patricii coire et interreyem creavere.
