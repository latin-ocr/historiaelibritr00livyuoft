noras To BOOK 11. c. 45, 46. 217

⁵⁵ qu istos] “I know that these soldiers can conquer the
enemy3 but, by their conduct, they themselves caused me not to
be certain that they wished to do it.’'

⁵³ Inter primores puynae flaqitator] “Among the principal
persons in calling for a battle.

⁵¹, Iratos invocat deos] “And imprecates on himself, should
he deceive, the anger of Jove, Mars Gradivus, and the other
gods.'' Gradivus, see B. 1. c. 20. n. 31.

⁵⁵ In se quisquejurat] See B. 2. c. 24. n. 18.

⁵⁶ Nunc armatis sibi quisque] “ Now that they are under arms,

'they bid, every man of them, the enemy, who was so bold in
tongue, to present himself before them? Ι am not certain whe-
ther the words, sibi quisque, may not mean that every Roman
should have his man (as we say) among the enemy.

⁵⁷ Etruscoeque leqiones] The Etrurian forces are called le-
qiones, Hor. Sat. 1. 6. 4. Leqz‘o seems to be used generally for
exercitus—See B. 1. c. 30. n. 54.

CHAP. XLV1.-⁵⁸ BIajus quoque aliquod] “ That some greater
deed also was not to be despaired of, in such a state of irritated
feeling, and on so doubtful an occasion? As the Romans before,
when sure of success against the AEqui, gave up the advantage, it
was not likely they would now hazard a battle, when they could
not be certain of the successful issue of it, and were besides in
such a state of discontent. Thus the enemy calculated on an
easy victory·

⁵⁹ Explicandi ordinis] Eoeplicandi ordines, or explicandis ordi-
nibus, would perhaps be a better reading. The first is proposed
by Gronovius3 the other, hy Drakenborch.

⁶⁰ Abjectis] “Rather thrown off at random, than aimed at
the enemy

⁶¹ Puyna jam in manus, jam ad qladios, venerat] Though
some editions read ad manus, and Livy, ch. 30, has, ad manum
venisset hostis, yet in manus here is more correct3 it is the rea-
ding of the MSS.; and the phrase, in manus venire, “to come
to close engagement,” is a very common one. Livy is very fond
of varying his expressions, particularly prepositions. B. 6. ch.
8, terroremque non in primam tantum aciem, sed eiiam ad subsi-
diarios, perlatum—B. 4. c. 56, seu...in spem, seu ad iram, compu-
lissei. B. 7. c. 13, ad bellum, non in. exilium, missos. B. 5. c. 7,
ut diversae leyiones, alioe adversus Capenatem, alioe eontra erupti-
onem oppidanorum, puqnarent. B. 27. e. 50, nunquam....aut
senator quisquam ὰ curia atque ab maqistratibus abscessit, aut
populus ἓ foro.

⁶² Principem] “ Before the rest.”

⁸³ Proeceps in vulnus abiit] When the Tuscan plucked out the
sword, Fabius fell forward on his breast, where he received the
wound. The word abiit, says Burman ad Quinctil. declam. 9. c. 5,
is expressive of the force and quickness with which he fell. So,
B. 1. c. 58, prolapsaque in vulnus. So, cadere in vulnus, Statius.-
