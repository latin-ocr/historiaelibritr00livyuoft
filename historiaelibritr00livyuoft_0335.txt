sul from his purpose?

⁵⁰ In reliquum] “ For the time to come.’'
⁸¹ Fuere in patrum potestate] “ Submitted to the wish of the

patricians.” Esse in potestate is a phrase that often occurs to

imply, “to submit to one's authority or wish.” Esse in aucto-
ritate signifies the same.

⁸² Reficiebant] “ Were going to re-elect-.''

Β Actia] Actio and aqere are particularly applied to
harangoes, or any public discussion before the people.

⁰² Elevatis] This verb properly means “ to lessen the weight
of any thing;’' hence “to diminish in value and hnportance.'’
Levare is sometimes used in the same sense.-See e. 72.

⁸⁵ Ne temeritati] “Lest ye may yield to the populace in
rashness.”

⁸⁵ Aliorum exempla] Rather pursue the bad example of
others, than teach them to pursue yom- good example. This

B. 33. c. 24.

’Β Sed qloriam] “But that the glory of my refusing the
honour of continuing in office has been thus augmented.'’

θ’ communiter inde edicunt] “ Then they issue their joint
orders.'’ As the consuls presided at the comitia curiata, they
oould take care that the decree of the senate was not violated
in the election of consuls. But over the comitia tributa, where
the tribunes were elected, they had no control, as they did not
preside or attend there.

division behind the first line.'' Gronovius thinks we should
read sua, and refer it to principia ,· or suos, or suoe quemque,
or suoe quosque, and refer the words to equites. But these altera-
tions are unnecessary, as there are many instances of the
present style in the best authors. See B. 25. c. 17.-—Virg. Ecl.
7. 54.-Caes. Bell. Civ. 1. c. 83.-Suet. in Aug. c. 40. Post
principia ; see B. 2. c. 65. He posts the Roman cavalry behind
