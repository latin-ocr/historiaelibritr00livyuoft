94 NOTES 'ro Boon 1. c. 34, 35, 36.

¹⁶ Lame—decus] “Lifted the ornament,” i. e. his cap.—
Divinitas, “ by the will of heaven.”

²⁷ L. Tarquinium Priscum edidere nomem] As he did not
take this name until afterwards, this expression should be re-
jected: yet it must be confessed Livy uses the figure prolepsis
not unfrequently. See B. 8. c. 18.

¹⁸ Notitiamque eam.] ‘⁶ And that acquaintance with the royal
family he in a short time, by paying his court to the king with
politeness and address, had improved so far, as to be admitted
to the privileges of familiar friendship.'’

¹⁹ Erpertua] “ Being proved faithfu1.''

CnAP. XXXV.-²⁰ Ableqavit.] This properly signifies “to
send out of the way whatever may be an annoyance or impedi-
ment.” Sub tempus, “ a little before the time of the comitia.”

⁸¹ Quum, se non rem novam petere, ᾆέ.] Either quum
must be expunged, or some such word as diceret, or memoraret,
must be understood.

’Β Ultra] Without the thing being expected by him. See
c. 5. n. 75.

²⁸ Sui potens] “ Ever since he became his own master.”

⁹⁴ Minor-um qentium] “Of younger or inferior families.”
This name was given to those more meritorious and opulent ple-
beians, who were elected into the order of the patricians, and
afterwards into the senate. At this time the number of 300
senators was made up. Majorum qentium patres were those whose
fathers were patricians under Romulus and Tatius.

¹⁵ Fac-tio haud dubia reqis.] “ Undoubtedly a faction belonging
to the king.”

Β Ρνιεᾱᾶ majore, qucim quanta belli fama suerat] “Having
brought back from it a greater share of booty than could be ex-
pected from a war of such little notoriety.’' The ellipsis is thus
filled up 1—BIajore proedd, qutim tanta proeda erat, quanta belli

ama erat.
f ²⁷ ,ζ’ζὶιεετασιιῐω] “ Seats,” from which they may see the games.

’Β Spectat-era] They remained during the games on these
seats, supported by props twelve feet high from the ground.—
Literally, “ They beheld the games, props supporting the seatS,
which were in height twelve feet from the ground.” DionysiuS‚
B. 3. p. 200, says that this circus lay between the Aventine and
Palatine 3 that the seats were covered overhead with a separate
division for each fratria ; and that, before this, the spectators
stood up.

CHAP. XXXV1.-2⁹ Divine tu, imaqura.] “ Come, you
diviner, tell me by your augm'y.”-—So ch. 6, ad inaugurandum
templa capiunt. Several copies and MSS. read divina inauqu-
rata ; but inauqurare, when transitive, in the common gram-
matieal sense of the word, means “to choose or consecrate a
place for taking omens.''-—So B. 3. c. 20.
