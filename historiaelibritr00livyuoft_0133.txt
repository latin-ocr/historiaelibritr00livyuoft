NOTEs To BOOK 1. c. 58, 59. 115

⁶⁷ Pestiferam] “Which was destructive to me, and, if you
be men, to himself also.”

ω Mentem peccare] ‘⁶ That, it is the mind, and not the body,
that. commits crime 3 and that, where there is 110 intention, there
is no guilt.”

⁶⁹ Cultrum, quem—eum defiqit.] Eum is 1101 necessary here,
either for syntax or meaning3 its introduction is a pleonasm
borrowed from the Greeks, particularly the Attics, who at the
conclusion of a sentence or member, introduce the demonstra-

· tive pronoun, to add emphasis to the substantive it agrees with.

To the reader of Demosthenes, such a pleonasm is familiar.—
See B. 3. c. 64. n.

CHAP. LIX.—⁷⁰ Eoesecuturum] “ That Ι will pursue.'’ This
verb is similarly used elsewhere.

'¹¹ Expuqnandum requam-J “ To destroy kingly power.”—See
c. 58. n. 61.

'¹² In forum] i. e. The forum of Collatia„

⁷³ Castiqator] “ Who rebuked them for their tears.''

⁷⁴ Pari praesidio relicto Collatiae ad portas] Equal to the
number that went to Rome, say the commentators. Gronovius
and others would prefer pars praesia'io relicti. I think these
words simply mean “an adequate” or “sufficient guard;'' par,
frequently, in Livy and other authors, means what is a “ match ;”
what is “ adequate or sufficient for” 3 thing. There appears to
me no good reason why he should make an even division of his
forces (as the commentators explain the passage,) and besides⁴
Collatia, from its comparative insignificance, did not require as
many men to keep down Tarquin’s party, as was necessary to be
sent 10 the capital city, Rome. Custodibus datis ; the custodes
here seem to be commanders of this guard.

⁷⁵ Reyz‘bus] The king and his children.

⁷⁶ Primores civitatis] These, it seems, were Lucretius, Col-
latinus, and Brutus, and not the patricians generally. This was
on the first appearance of the armed multitude from Collatia3
it is not. even hinted that this body was as yet joined by the
Romans 3 011 1110 contrary, it is said they were terror-struck by it.

⁷⁷ Haud temera] “ Not without some good cause-’²

⁷⁵³ Tribunum Celerum] “ The master of the horse.'’ The
horse were called celeres, ch. 15. This Livy mentions to show
that he could convene a meeting of the people, as being a ma-
gistrate, nobody else having authority to do so. See Dionysius,
Β. 4. p. 266.

'¹⁹ Tricipitini] Lucretius.

⁸⁰ Cui morte filice causa morti-sn] ‘⁴ Who must feel the cause
of his daughter’s death a source of greater indignation and
misery than her death itself.”

⁸¹ His atrocioribusque] “ By detailing these, and, Ι believe,
other fact-s still more shocking‚ which the then heinous state of
