nores 'ro BOOK 111. c. 72. 357

illi (victores) per fastidium et contumaciam hebescunt. cvaesar,
Bell. civil. B. 1. c. 31, nam neque pudentis suspicari oportet, sibi
parum credi ,⁴ neque improbos scire, sese timeri ,· quod illis (scil.
improbis) licentiam timor auqeat noster, his (scil. pudentibus)
studia deminuat.-See Cic. Fam. 7. 2.·-pro Rosc. 86.-—-See Sanc.
Miner. 2. 9.

ἃ Scaptione hoc, concionali senix] ‘⁶ Could they imagine that it

is to Scaptius, an old frequenter of public assemblies (and eona
sequently an idler‚ and silly prattler,) they would ascribe this
dishonourable act, and not to the whole body of the people.”
. Β Clarum hac fore imaqine Scaptium] i. e. That this act
would serve as an image to ennoble Scaptius hereafter. The
images of one’s ancestors‚ as has been observed before, were an
evidence of his illustrious birth, because no man, who had not
filled a curule office, could have the privilege of setting up his
image.

⁸⁸ Populum Romanum quadruplatoris et interceptoris litis alienae
personam laturum] “ That the Roman people would bear the
character of corrupt informer-s and usurpers of the subject in
dispirte between others-'⁹ Quadruplatores were certain public
informers, so called, either because they obtained as a reward the
fourth part (quartam partem) of the criminal’s effects, or of the
fine imposed on him3 or because they accused personS, who, upon
conviction, were obliged to pay fourfold, (quadrupli damnaban-
tun) such as those guilty of gambling, illegal usury, or the like.
The word was sometimes used in a general sense, to signify any
persons who intended to promote their interest by any artful or
dishonourable means, such as corrupt judges (as perhaps here),
false and mercenary accusers or litigante, calumniatores, or the
like.

ὖ Ut sibi controversiosam adjudicaret rem.] “To adjudge
to himself the property under debate.’³ controversiosam here
is a rare word, and used for controversam, which is the reading
of some copies.

⁸⁶ Haud sane quicquam bono caucae levatur dedecus judicia]
“ The infamy of the decision is not indeed in any way dimi-
nished by the justice of the cause.'’ Levatur here is the
same as elevatur, which is another reading.-=—See c. 21. n. 84.
