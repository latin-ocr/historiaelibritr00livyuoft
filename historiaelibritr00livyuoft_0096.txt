²⁵ Janum ad infimum Arqiletum] “ A temple to Janus at the
foot of Argiletus.'' This was a little eminence to the east of
the Palatine Hill, so called from Argus, who was murdered
there, ’Agybv ἑλεῖν. Or perhaps from letum, “ death.''

¹⁷ Bellum Actiacum] It appears that Livy began his work
about this time, (as the temple was shut five years after, ou the

edition of Ainsworth’s Dictionary.
