⁵³ Dirutum. Ἰ. Yet, in ch. 22, he speaks of Pometia and Cora as
places that then flourished, and, in ch. 25, talks of the capture and
plunder of Suessa Pometia3 in consequence of which inconsistency,
it is considered probable that Livy, following different writers,
described the same war in two different places, Dionysius
makes no mention of this war with the Aurunci.

CHAP. XVIII.-⁵⁴ Rebellionem] “ A renewal of war.'’ The

⁵⁵ Latini belli] It appears that we should, according to some
MSS„ read Sabini, as the thirty states, which are presently said
to have conspired, were not Latins. And also read super,
“ besides‚⁷' as this is the word Livy generally makes use of.—
Ch. 27 and 5l.-B. 22. 61.-Β. 25. c. 20, et alibi.

⁵⁷ Nec quo anno, nec quibus consulibus, quia ex factione Tar-
quinia* essent, ...... parum creditum sit] ‘⁶ But it is not sufficiently
clear in what year3 or what consuls were distrusted, as being of
Tarquin’s party3 for that too is handed down to us as a reason
for appointing one.⁷' If a semicolon were placed after anno, the
much-talked-of difficulty of this passage would, in my opinion,
be diminished. Dionysius says that a dictator was appointed
four years before this, when Lartius and Claelius were consuis.
The people, complaining during the war with Tarquin of some
oppression on the part of the senate, refused to enlist3 and, as
the consuls, in consequence of the privilege of appeal from
their decisions, which was granted to the people by Valerius,
could not compe] them, a dictator was appointed. They willingly
submitted to an absolute master, in order to abridge the power
of the senate and consuls. The authority of the dictator lasted
but six months Sylla was the first to extend t'he time. He
could not go out of Italy, or march on horseback, without the
permission of the people. He was elected by night, and the
nomination had to be confirmed by auspices. He commanded
the infantry, and appointed a person called “master of the
horse” to command the cavalry. He was himself sometimes
called maqister populi.

⁵⁸ Consulares leqere] “ Men of consular rank elected him.”
Crevier and others say the words mean, “they (the patri-
cians) appointed men of consular rank to the office ;’' but in that
case Manius Valerius Postumius, next ch„ could not possibly be
dictator.

⁵⁹ Lea-jubebat] This law was afterwards somewhat altered.
He was elected by one of the consuls, or military tribunes, ,
during the period of their substitution for the consuls.

⁶⁰ Consularis] 'Dionysius says he was consul. But as Livy
