⁹¹ Dissuasum prodeuntibus] “ Many coming forward to the
assembly to give advice to the contrary.”

⁹⁸ C'. Claudia] This was the uncle of Ap. Claudius.

⁹⁴ Gratiam] “A requital for their private services to a
tribune ;’' i. e. Virginius.

CHAP. LXIV.—⁹⁵ Prope in haud salubrem luxuriam vertit]
“ Turned nearly into pernicious licentiousness.’'

⁹⁶ Per contumeliam consulum] “Through the insuit offered
to the consuls.’'—So, c. 59. n. 56. invidiam consulum.

⁹⁷ Factiones] This word was generally applied to the con-
fedei-acies formed among the patricians; partes, to those formed
among the plebeians; factio, or factiones nobilitatis ,· pars,
or partes plebis, are expressions often found in the Latin
classics.

⁹³ Neqaret ullius se rationem habiturum] “Who, when he
declared that he would take no account of any of the former
tribunes, ;'’ i. e. would admit no vote for them.—See B. 4.
c· 7. By this it is seen what power the presiding magistrate had.

ω Puqnarentque colleqae, ut liberas tribus in suffrayium mit-
teret] “ And when his colleagues fought with him to allow the
tribes to vote independently 3 i. e. for whomsoever they pleased.
Puqno, like μάχομαι, is applied to a struggle or contention of
any kind, even to verbal bickering3 the word “ fight’' in English,
is often used with the same latitude.

¹ Aut concederet sortem comitiorum colleyis] “ Or give up to
his colleagues the charge of presiding at the election.”

² Injectci contentione] “A contest being thus excited.” Injz'cere
often meanS, in Livy, “to excite, to cause, to give,’' as, injicere
alicui metum, injicere pavorem, swam, certamen, mutationem, admi-
rationem, ardorem, spem, and the like.

⁸ Auctores popularis sententiae, haud populares nactus] The
text here is undoubtedly wrong3 the reading should be, auctores
populares sententiae haud popularis ; ἱ. e. having got popular sup-
porters (i. e. the consuls) of his unpopular measure3 namely, his
intention not to re-elect the former tribunes,

⁴ Collaudatis consulibua] “After he eulogized the consuls

 

because they persevered to the last to be quite the opposite of
thedecemvirs, ” Similis, as has been already shown, when
followed by &genitive means “ the very resemblance or 'likeness
of,'⁹ and dissimilis, “ quite contrary to.''

⁵ Alii candidati tribus non explerent] “'When the other can-
didates (i. e. besides the five elected) could not make up the
'requisite number of tribes, (i. e. of votes to elect them,) in con-
sequence of the zeal with which the other nine tribunes (ί. e. the
colleagues of Duilius).openly pressed their canvass, he dismissed
' the assembly.” Emplere centurias means the same as explere
tribus. So, B. 37. c. 47. Fulvius consul unus creatur, cum caeteri
centurias no'n explessent. .
