⁵⁸ Cunctantem] “ Hesitating ;'’ prolatantem, “ procrastinating.’¹

to things which are not deferred, but put into execution at once.
—So, Cic. Phil. 2, peroration, eqo corpu-s· libenter obtulerim, εἰ
repraesentari morte med libertas civitatis posset. Repraesentare
pretium means ‘³ to pay down the price of a thing at once? So,
repraesentare poenam, “to punish at once ;” repraesentare proemium,
“ to reward at once.”

emp, ΧΧΧῩἿΙΡ-58 8εᾳιιίιιε.] “What may stigmatize.''

crime already committed by them3 but to take care, &c.;'’ or,
perhaps, “ to caution them, &c.” When admitto means “ to

ἃ Ut urbe excederent Volsci] “ That the Volsci should leave
the city ;²' urbem excederent, is another and very general reading,
i. e. eoetra urbem excederent. So, Β. 3. c. 41, ultra vocem exces-
sisset. Eqredi is also found often with an accusative, which is
explained in the same way—So B. 3. c. 57, urbem eqrederentur.
So is elabi, evadere, and most verbs compounded with e or er.—
