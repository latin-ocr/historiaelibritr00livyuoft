⁶⁷ Familia armata] “ A band of armed slaves.” Familia
(from famulus, “ a slave,'') properly signified the body of slaves
that belonged to any individua13 hence it came to be taken,
in a. more general sense, to signify all the “domestics” of a
house, (so to speak,) including wife, children, dcc. Sometimes
it means a man’s whole property.—See c. 55.

⁶⁸ Sacrz'...sancti.] Sacer is what is consecrated by religion3

'⁵ De proferendo exercitu] “ Began to exert themselves to
delay the marching of the army.'' This, it must be confessed, is
rather a forced explanation of these words, though it is the
only one they can bear, as it is evident, from the next chapter,
