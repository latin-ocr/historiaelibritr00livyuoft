NOTES TO PREFACE.

¹ Tm: dignity and modesty of this preface, says Walker, is
quite in· unison with the character which Horace (Art. Poet.)
gives of a good writer: Non fumum ex fulyore, sed eaefumo dare
lucem, coqz'tat.
⁹ Facturusne operoe pretium sim] The best editions and MSS.
read, facturusne sim operae pretium, by which the hiatus of the
present reading would be avoided3 but the authority of Quinc-
tilian, who asserts that Livy commences with part of an hexa-
meter line, is sufficient to decide that this reading should not be
introduced into the text, and considered genuine.
³ Quippe qui] Livy says, that he is not certain whether he
will obtain any reward for his labour in writiug this history—
whether its merits be such as to secure the approbation of the
present age and posterity3 and that, even if he were, he would not
venture to say so, because it has been, from time immemorial, a
practice with every new writer of history, to boast that “his‘’ work
must excel that of his predecessors, as the facts are to be detailed
with more certainty and truth, and “ their ” unpolished and anti-
quated style of writing (rudem vetustatem, ) excelled by the
superior strength and elegance of the new production3 and that,
as the practice is so old (veterem), it has become vulgar and
contemptible (vulyatum). Vulqatus, in Livy and Pliny, often has
the same signification as vilis. In this way facturus operae pretium,
and vulqatum, are explained by Walker and others 3'but on reflec-
tion it appears-very doubtful, whether the first does not mean,
“ to make it worth the ‘ reader’s ³ trouble and perusal,'’ and the
second, “common or general,’' which is the usual signification
of vulqatus.*
⁴ Utcunque erit] This refers to the first line. “ However
that shall be.'³
⁵ Pro virili parte] To the utmost of my power, like pro me,
01· κατ’ ἐμαυτὸν, in Greek.
⁶ Et ipsum consuluisse] ‘⁶ That I also (as well as other writers)
have provided for the recollection of a people that ruled the
world ;” i. e. have taken care that they should be recollected. M'e
is sometimes, as here, suppressed before ipsum—So Virg. Ecl. 1. z

“ Ille meas errare boves, ut cernis, et ipsum
Ludere, quae vellem, calamo permisit agresti.”

’ἓ Esse opera» pretium is what is generally employed to signify “to be worth
·‘ one's own' trouble.‘’
