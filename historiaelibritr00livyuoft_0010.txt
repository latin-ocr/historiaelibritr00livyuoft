curiosity, returned liome contented. For some time he
prosecuted his work, of which, as they were finished,
he read part-s before Augustus, MaecenaS, and the
greatest men of the empire‚ and of that age. But dis-
tracted and wearied with the politieal tumults‚ factious
cabals, and 601111 intrigues, that at that time ruffled the
public peace, disorganized society, poisoned socia] inter-
course, and withered private happiness, he withdrew
from Rome, the great theatre of agitation, and sought
113 iquilhtv and retirement in the 11111(1 611111316 and de-

Lucius Florus, author of a portion of Roman history.
