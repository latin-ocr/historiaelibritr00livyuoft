NOTES To BOOK 1. c. 43. 99

ciui* XLIIL-22 Centum millium aeria] “A fortune of one
hundred thousand asses, or pounds weight of brass.’‘ This does
not mean their yearly income, but their whole property. The
value of money (which was mostly brass) at this time was esti-
mated by weight3 an as was about three farthings of our money.

⁹³ Quadraqenas seniorum ac juniorum] “ Forty of the elder,
and forty of the younge1·.’' The elder were those who had attained
the age of forty-six3 the younger (juvenes or juniores) from
seventeen to fort-y-six.

⁹⁴ Fabi-am centuria] Dionysius says these belonged to the

y second class.

⁹⁵ Ut machinas in bello ferrat] Lipsius (B. 3. Poliorcet.
Dial. 6,) thinks, with great justice, that we should read facerent
here for firrent. Dionysius, Β. 4. p. 222, sayS, there were two
centuries 0‘2-2091-0152 καὶ emerium.

⁹⁵ Senioribus junioribusque] “ Ten senior and ten junior.’'

⁹⁷ Clypea] This was round and shorter than the scutum,
which was oblong. Livy B. 8. c. 8, says that all soldiers, after
they began to receive pay, used the scutum. Polybius, B. 6,
says, that this was four feet long and two and a half broad, and
covered the whole body, which Homer expresses by the words
ἀμφῖβςοτος, “ covering the man all over,” and ποδηνεκὴς, “ reach-
ing to the feet.'’ He describes Hector’s shield, when slung on
his back, reaching from head to foot, B. 6. 117, as follows :

Ἀμφὶ δέ μιν σφυρὰ «τύπτε, καὶ αὒχὲνα Seque), κέλαινσν
” Αντυξ, ἦ πυμάτη θέεν ἀσπίδος ὀμφαλοέσσης.

⁹⁸ Proeter loricam, omnia eadem] This second class had all the
armoni· and weapons of the first, except the lorica ; the third
class wanted the lorica and ocreoe.

⁹⁰ Tertioe classis in quinquaqinta millium censum esse] “He
enacted that the fortune of the third class should be from seventy-
five to fifty thousand asses.'' The words, as they stand, are ob-
scure ; it is likely that censum is understood. Crevier says centurias
is the word understood. Drakenborch says that no word is under-
stood, but that millia should be written for millium, as it was
originally written in L. M. in the MSS. which gave rise to the
mistake. This is quite probable. Some copies read tertiam
classem in quinquaqinta .· some, in tertiat classe quinquaqinta, ᾆτ.
The explanation in Walker's edition is decidedly wrong3 it says,
cert), Livius voluit tertiam classem institutam fuisse intra septuaqinta
usque ad quinquaqinta millium censum. Surely it. should be, intra
quinque et septuaqinta usque ad. Seventy-five thousand asses
constituted the minimum property as a qualification for the
second class; and from that down to fifty thousand was the pro-
perty of the thjrd class. One of Vossius's MSS. has, tertia classis,
quam intra quinque et septuaqinta usque in quinquaqinta millium
